            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> was loth to part with his <hi>An≈øwerer</hi> without <hi>asking him in civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity how he did:</hi>

I would intreat him to go back with me as far as to <hi>a Papi≈øt Mi≈ørepre≈øented and Repre≈øented,</hi> that we may ≈øee how matters have been carried all along, ≈øince that Book gave occa≈øion to this Controver≈øy. How I ≈øhall ≈øpeed in this Reque≈øt,

               <note place="margin">Prot. &amp;c. p. 125.</note> is hard to ≈øay, for 'tis a favour that his Second Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary did not obtain, who fairly led the way, when the Walk was not quite ≈øo long as it is grown ≈øince. But with, or without his Company, this is the way I mu≈øt needs go; and becau≈øe I will not do it, without giving the <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> a Rea≈øon, 'tis this: I hope to ≈øatisfy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60861:3"/>tho≈øe who will go along with me, That he has but je≈øted all this while; and (to make his words ≈øpeak truth for once) has <hi>pa≈ø≈øed over all his</hi> Adver≈øaries An≈øwers <hi>with a light touch</hi> (mo≈øt of them with none at all) <hi>and the mo≈øt Artificial way of</hi> replying, <label type="milestone">

               <hi>with ≈øaying nothing to 'em, as can po≈ø≈øibly be met with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was well done of him to tell the Reader in the Title Page of his la≈øt <hi>Reply,</hi> That it was a <hi>Fourth Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a Papi≈øt Mi≈ørepre≈øented,</hi> &amp;c. for if he had not ≈øaid ≈øo, really men could not have believed it. There were <hi>Thirty ≈øeven</hi> double Characters of a <hi>Papi≈øt</hi> laid down with ≈øolemn order in the fir≈øt Book, to tell the World what he is by us fal≈øly ≈øaid to be, and what he is truly in him≈øelf: And this later <hi>Character</hi> was fortified with ≈øuch Arguments to ju≈øtify his Faith and Practi≈øe, as could be had. What now is become of all this? What ≈øaies the <hi>Fourth Vindication</hi> in defence of any one particular Complaint, Repre≈øentation, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? Why not a word that I can find, unle≈øs it be where he barely asks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> What we think of <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> and of ≈øome few other things, and of more than he would ≈øpeak of, <hi>which ≈øtand charged upon the Character of a Papi≈øt Mi≈ørepre≈øented.</hi> He puts the≈øe Que≈øtions ≈øhortly and confidently, as if nothing had been yet ≈øaid to any of them. And his behaviour would almo≈øt per≈øwade a man, that his double Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were yet to be con≈øidered, and his Rea≈øons yet to be An≈øwered. So one would think indeed by comparing his fir≈øt and la≈øt Books together, without ob≈øerving what has come between them; or, at lea≈øt, that the Cau≈øe is dropt by one Side, or the other: And let him that thinks ≈øo, think ≈øo ≈øtill; for that is the plain Truth of the Ca≈øe, which I ≈øhall make out by an Argument that will do the bu≈øine≈øs to the ≈øatisfaction
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60861:3"/>of all men but the <hi>Repre≈øenter;</hi> and that is, That <hi>He</hi> hath dropt it.</p>
            <p>This I ≈øhall do in the <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> place, if it be but to try whether he will take notice of it in the beginning of this An≈øwer, tho he would not be≈øtow a word upon it,

            <p>And perhaps, now that the length of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øy, together with the windings and turnings of the <hi>Repre≈øenter,</hi> has made it ≈øomething, unea≈øy to be comprehended; it may not be ungrateful to tho≈øe that have concerned them≈øelves in it, to have ≈øome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pro≈øpect of it, all at once before them; which I ≈øhall make as ≈øhort and as ea≈øy as I can, in going through the ≈øeveral Books that have been written in this Cau≈øe, ≈øince the fir≈øt.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øwer to In‚à£troduction. </seg>
                  </label> in which, the Learned Author, having fir≈øt made ≈øome Exceptions again≈øt the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenter</hi>'s way of proceeding in his double Characters, went on to examine his Characters Point by Point. Every Que≈øtion was particularly and exactly ≈øtated, and the ≈øen≈øe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about it was ≈øhewn, by the Decrees of the <hi>Trent</hi>-Council, or their <hi>Roman</hi> Catechi≈øm, or their Publick Offices, and their mo≈øt approved Divines and Ca≈øui≈øts, as the matter required. This was done very di≈øtinctly throughout the whole <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> where he ≈øaw cau≈øe to correct the ≈øtate of the Que≈øtion; that the Reader might ≈øee the grounds of every particular charge, that we and our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60861:4"/>Fathers have laid again≈øt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus, by the way, all the fal≈øe colours of the <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> were taken off, where he thought it for his purpo≈øe to lay them on too Foul on his <hi>Mi≈ørepre≈øenting,</hi> or too Fair on his <hi>Repre≈øenting</hi> ≈øide.</p>
               <p>But this was not all; for whereas the <hi>Repre≈øenter,</hi> not altogether tru≈øting to his Arts of Repre≈øentation, thought fit ≈øometimes to urge, never fail'd to in≈øinuate, Arguments in favour of his ≈øide of the Que≈øtion; The <hi>An≈øwerer,</hi> without omitting any ≈øhadow of Rea≈øon offered by the <hi>Repre≈øenter,</hi> took all his Argumentations, and every pretence from Scripture, into particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I ≈øay, he took them one by one in their place and order, and made it appear, that they were very faulty; as we at lea≈øt thought, and as we may think ≈øtill, for any thing that we have heard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Nay, to give occa≈øion to a more perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of the≈øe matters, He took <hi>Popery as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented by the Repre≈øenter</hi> him≈øelf in one Colume, and gave him <hi>Our Rea≈øons again≈øt it,</hi> in another.</p>
               <p>And becau≈øe, to gain the greater opinion of ≈øincerity, the <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> had with <hi>Anathema</hi>'s di≈øclaimed ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral points, which, as he ≈øaid, are imputed to <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> by <hi>Prote≈øtants;</hi> the <hi>An≈øwerer</hi> con≈øidered him here too, very particularly, and ≈øeemed to di≈øcover in≈øincerity in the <hi>Repre≈øenter,</hi> even where one would be mo≈øt apt to believe him to be in good earne≈øt.</p>
               <p>To all which I mu≈øt add, That this was done through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with that Calmne≈øs and Moderation, that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary did not think fit to di≈ø≈øemble it. So that this Book wanted nothing to make it de≈øerve a fair and full Reply, or at lea≈øt ≈øome honourable ≈øort of Conce≈ø≈øion, That the Subject would not bear it.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60861:4"/>
               <p>For ≈øurely no Method of An≈øwering the <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> could be more Compleat, Hone≈øt, and Manly, than this was; nor ≈øerve better to put all tho≈øe, for who≈øe ≈øake Books are written, into a way of judging what Popery indeed is, and whether we have rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it or no, if they were not already ≈øatisfied in the≈øe things; e≈øpecially becau≈øe all was done with that plainne≈øs and per≈øpicuity, that if the Di≈øcour≈øe was in any particular greatly defective, it could not but be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to an Adver≈øary, that was, it ≈øeems, thought a fit Per≈øon by his Superiors, to Repre≈øent Popery to this Kingdom, and to defend it again≈øt this Church.</p>

Did he, as the <hi>An≈øwerer</hi> has done before him, take the Que≈øtions in their Order, to examine how they were ≈øtated, and where need was, did he pretend to ≈øtate them better? Nay, Did he bear up fairly to any one point of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentation that his Adver≈øary thought fit to alter, and try by the force of his Learning to reduce it to what it was when he left it? No truly, his mind did not ≈øerve him, for ≈øtating of Que≈øtions.</p>
               <p>But did he not ≈øtand up in defence of his <hi>Anathema</hi>'s which his <hi>An≈øwerer</hi> charged, not without giving Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons for it, with <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Sophi≈øtry?</hi> No, he did not ≈øo much as offer at it.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60861:5"/>
               <p>What then was the bu≈øine≈øs of his <hi>Reflections?</hi> Did they turn upon <hi>our Rea≈øons again≈øt Popery as Repre≈øented</hi> by the <hi>Repre≈øenter?</hi> No ≈øure; Nor was it likely that he ≈øhould be forward to an≈øwer our Arguments, that had no Fancy to defend his own.</p>
               <p>What? Did he not betake him≈øelf to make good his own particular Arguments in behalf of Popery, again≈øt his Adver≈øaries An≈øwers? Nothing le≈øs, I a≈ø≈øure you; he did not take care ≈øo much as of one Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to any one point, but fairly left them all to take their Fortune: Is it not enough for a man to bring Arguments, but he mu≈øt be troubled to defend them? Well; From this time forward, the <hi>Repre≈øenters</hi> bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs was not to <hi>Di≈øpute,</hi> but to <hi>Repre≈øent.</hi> But was it ≈øo from the beginning? The <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> indeed has ever ≈øince ≈øo vehemently di≈øclaimed <hi>Di≈øputing,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he only <hi>Repre≈øented</hi> at fir≈øt. Let us therefore try that a little.</p>
               <p>Were there not three Arguments for <hi>Veneration of Images,</hi> and for <hi>Praying to Saints?</hi> Were not <hi>Mo≈øes, Job, Stephen,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the <hi>Ephe≈øians,</hi> and <hi>almo≈øt every ≈øick Per≈øon that de≈øires the Prayers of the Congregation,</hi> engaged one way or other? Did he not argue for <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation</hi> from our Saviours <hi>Words,</hi> from the <hi>Power</hi> of God, from the incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of <hi>Sen≈øe</hi> and <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> to judg in this, no le≈øs than in ≈øome other ca≈øes? I think this is <hi>Di≈øputing.</hi> There were three Texts of Scripture to ju≈øtifie the <hi>Re≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> people <hi>from reading the Scripture.</hi> And if they are not vani≈øhed out of the Book, there are about ≈øeven Rea≈øons for <hi>Communion in one Kind:</hi> The 12th Chapter of the 2d Book of <hi>Maccab.</hi> was once thought one good Authority for the Doctrine of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatoy;</hi> and St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32, another; And a little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60861:5"/>pretence of Antiquity there was be≈øide, and three or four more Rea≈øons for it; and in this ≈øtrain the Book went all along: Now this I ≈øay, Tho≈øe Arguments were not made by the <hi>An≈øwerer,</hi> but they were an≈øwered by him, and ≈øo were all the re≈øt, and now they may go ≈øhift for them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>And yet this is the Gentleman, who with no ≈ømall opinion of him≈øelf, takes his Adver≈øary to task for <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Arguments drop,</hi> nay, <hi>for not ≈øaying one word to all his own Rea≈øons pre≈ø≈øed again≈øt him≈øelf;</hi>

Now this is a biting Accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it be a <hi>True</hi> one; and before we part, I hope we ≈øhall have a word or two about <hi>that.</hi> But if it were as true, as I am well a≈ø≈øured 'tis fal≈øe, the <hi>Repre≈øenter,</hi> of all men living, ≈øhould have made no words on't; and that not only becau≈øe him≈øelf is a mo≈øt notorious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of for≈øaking his own Arguments in their di≈øtre≈øs, but becau≈øe his Adver≈øary was ≈øo generous to wink at <hi>him</hi> when <hi>he</hi> ≈øtole off from his Di≈øputing po≈øt, upon the very fir≈øt attack that was made upon <hi>him.</hi> For I do not remember that he charges him with this, in ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the progre≈øs of the Controver≈øie; and indeed, con≈øidering all his other Advantages, there was no need of it.

               <p>Well, but what went the <hi>Reflections</hi> upon, all this while? By this time I think a ≈øtranger may gue≈øs the Truth, and that is, that the <hi>Reflections</hi> were to flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up and down between the An≈øwer to the <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> and the An≈øwer to the <hi>Book;</hi> and to ≈øettle

               <p>Now really this would almo≈øt per≈øwade a Man to let him go for good and all; as he might have done if he had ob≈øerved but a little moderation.

               <p>I tell him therefore, in the fir≈øt place, that a clo≈øe Di≈øputant would have pre≈ø≈øed him to ≈øhew, that the Rea≈øons upon which we proceed in our manifold Charge again≈øt the Papi≈øts are fal≈øe and un≈øatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and not have ≈øuffered him to run out into an Inquiry, whether the Rea≈øons upon which his <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Brother</hi> proceeds again≈øt us, be the ≈øame with them, or no. Or, if this were to be allowed him, we might be well excu≈øed from an≈øwering him in this matter; ≈øince the particular Controver≈øies which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath with the Di≈ø≈øenters, have been managed on her behalf, not ≈øo long ≈øince that it ≈øhould be forgotten; and the <hi>difference of the Ca≈øe</hi> between the Separation of Prote≈øtants from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of Di≈ø≈øenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was ≈øhewn after all, and that <hi>in very good earne≈øt.</hi> For this being not taken notice of by Repre≈øenter, it might very well ≈øet off our Debt to him for a <hi>Charge</hi> upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which him≈øelf meant <hi>little more than in je≈øt.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, altho he glories in this Charge more than in all his other Performances, yet ≈øince he frequently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that he intended no more by it, than to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi> our Charge again≈øt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis all one, as if he had given it under his hand, that his Cau≈øe is more ≈øafe by <hi>ridiculing</hi> what we ≈øay, than bye <hi>replying</hi> to it like a Di≈øputant.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60861:25"/>without much danger, leave things as they are, and put it to the venture, whether the World will not think ≈øo too.

               <p n="2">2. It is objected again≈øt us, that <hi>we make Gods of dead Men,</hi> and this is proved by the <hi>weekly Bills of Mortality,</hi> where our Churches are called by the ≈øame <hi>Titles</hi> that they had in times of Popery. Now if by, <hi>making Gods of dead Men,</hi> be meant making the Saints ≈øo many, Independent Deities, there is then a great deal of difference between what the <hi>Zealous Brother</hi> objects again≈øt us, and what <hi>We</hi> object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Papi≈øts, as well as between the Rea≈øons of our Objections: For we never object this again≈øt them. But if by this Expre≈ø≈øion be meant, giving that Wor≈øhip to the Saints, which belongs only to God and our Saviour; we then allow our Objection to be the ≈øame, but do think that we have much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rea≈øons to object this again≈øt the Papi≈øt, than that of a <hi>weekly Bill of Mortality.</hi> For we appeal to the <hi>Publick Addre≈ø≈øes</hi> which are made to Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints, with all the Circum≈øtances of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Adoration; to their <hi>Litanies</hi> and to the <hi>Hymns</hi> of their e≈øtabli≈øh'd Offices, wherein they are often in voked after the ≈øame manner, as God him≈øelf is; to their appropriating to particular Saints, di≈øtinct Powers of doing good to their Wor≈øhippers; to their Acknowledgment, that the Saints are Mediators of Interce≈ø≈øion; to the Prayers that are made to them in all places, as if they were omnipre≈øent; to the Sen≈øe al≈øo of their Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that they are to be prayed unto with <hi>mental</hi> as well as <hi>vocal</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as if they knew our Hearts. All which I hope is ≈øomething more than that in the <hi>weekly Bill of Mortality,</hi> and in common Conver≈øation, we call our Temples by the ≈øame Names they formerly had. And yet the Repre≈øenter asks, <hi>Wherein have I Ridiculed the Church of</hi> England? <hi>I have done no more in my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60861:26"/>Character again≈øt her, then what they have been doing the≈øe hundred and fifty Years again≈øt the Church of</hi> Rome? ≈øo that it ≈øeems we have for <hi>the≈øe hundred and fifty Years</hi> charged them with <hi>Wor≈øhipping</hi> the Saints upon no better grounds then their <hi>weekly Bills of Mortality. Only,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>what I have done in a kind of je≈øt, and without endeavouring to delude any body with ≈øuch kind of Sophi≈øtry, they have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the greate≈øt earne≈øt, and by it making good their Cau≈øe.</hi> So that he confe≈ø≈øes his Charge upon our Church to be carried on with a <hi>kind of Sophi≈øtry:</hi> only what he has done <hi>in a kind of je≈øt,</hi> we have been doing again≈øt them <hi>in the greate≈øt earne≈øt;</hi> i. e. we have in <hi>good earne≈øt</hi> charged the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with giving that Wor≈øhip to Saints which belongs to God only, upon nothing el≈øe but the <hi>Titles</hi> of Churches, ≈øuch as ours have in the <hi>Bills of Mortality.</hi> But ≈øurely his greate≈øt <hi>Sophi≈øtry</hi> of all lies in this, that he <hi>endeavours to delude</hi> People into this Opinion, which yet if he could, he mu≈øt delude them into another Opinion too, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Champions of old Popery, were a company of Fools, to be at ≈øo much <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>Charges</hi> to maintain the <hi>Wor≈øhip of Saints,</hi> and to defend it, as they have done, when they could ≈øo ea≈øily have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it.

               <p>To let pa≈øs his Sugge≈øtion, that the <hi>London Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were fir≈øt built by the Papi≈øts;</hi> his adding that we <hi>rebuilt them, with the ≈øame Titles, Invocations and Dedications which they u≈øe,</hi> ≈øhews how little he is to be tru≈øted in a Que≈øtion of Antiquity, who talks ≈øo carele≈øly of things that are notorious in our own
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60861:27"/>Days. Our Fathers indeed found the <hi>Titles</hi> conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient enough, and the <hi>Churches</hi> them≈øelves rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good Churches, and retain'd them both. But when we <hi>rai≈øed them out of their A≈øhes,</hi> we <hi>dedicated</hi> them to no Saint, whatever has been done in this kind formerly; nor have we ≈øince <hi>invocated</hi> any Saint in any one of them, but we keep the <hi>Titles</hi> ≈øtill. And does our new Repre≈øenter expect that we ≈øhould An≈øwer ≈øuch Objections as the≈øe? At lea≈øt I de≈øire him not to think that we will make a practice of it. Mu≈øt our retaining the≈øe Titles, nece≈ø≈øarily infer a virtual Dedication of our Temples to tho≈øe Saints, by who≈øe Names they are di≈øtingui≈øhed from one another? But what if we had called them by the Names of tho≈øe <hi>Streets</hi> only where they ≈øtand, had they then been <hi>dedicated to the Honour</hi> of the Streets? We ≈øay that the <hi>Hundred Thirty and Two</hi> Churches here, which are known by the Names <hi>dead Men and Women,</hi> are with us <hi>God's Hou≈øes,</hi> and dedicated to his only Service, no le≈øs than the <hi>Five</hi> that are di≈øtingui≈øhed by the Names of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And me thinks ≈øo acute a Di≈øputant as he is grown, might have ≈øeen that the Title of one Church di≈øtingui≈øhing it from the re≈øt, does not ≈øhew who is ≈øerved and wor≈øhipped there, when the ≈øame Service and Wor≈øhip is u≈øed in all of them. That which we blame them for is, that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to wor≈øhip <hi>Dead Men and Women</hi> in tho≈øe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which bear their Names, and in tho≈øe which do not. For if in <hi>Chri≈øt's Church</hi> they call upon the Ble≈ø≈øed Virgin; tho the Church has its <hi>Title</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> yet 'tis a <hi>Hou≈øe of Prayer</hi> to Her as well as to Him. And if in the Churches which are known by her Name, we call upon <hi>God only,</hi> and wor≈øhip him

                  <hi>alone,</hi> they are his <hi>Hou≈øes</hi> intirely, and none of Hers. But after all, where does the An≈øwerer pre≈øs him with the <hi>Titles</hi> of their Churches? And yet the Rea≈øons which pre≈øs home the Arguments, are they not the very ≈øame which the An≈øwerer him≈øelf urges again≈øt him the Repre≈øenter?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I confe≈øs that I have ≈øeen <hi>Pictures</hi> in ≈øome <hi>Engli≈øh Bibles</hi> and <hi>Common-prayer Books,</hi> and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> painted on <hi>each ≈øide of the Commandments</hi> upon ≈øome of our Altar pieces; which things how they have crept in among≈øt us I cannot tell, for they have no publick Authority from our Church. The An≈øwerer made his gue≈øs, and perhaps it will not be ea≈øy to mend it. But upon this great Occa≈øion, the Repre≈øenter has brought in his <hi>Rigid</hi> Brother making us wor≈øe than the Papi≈øts them≈øelves, forgetting that he undertook to repre≈øent us not altogether ≈øo Bad, and therefore he ≈øhould at lea≈øt have corrected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in this manner; <q>Indeed, Beloved, I told ye at fir≈øt, that the≈øe <hi>Church-of-England</hi>-Men are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Swing of the Dragon's Tail;</hi> but I had not lied to ≈øay that they are under the <hi>Feet</hi> and the <hi>Belly,</hi> more than the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> them≈øelves are. For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts do no more towards the <hi>placing of Image</hi>-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> than by a cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of that Commandment which forbids it, out of the way. But the≈øe Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, <hi>as they are called, have given that Abomination of Images them≈øelves, a place in every Leaf of their Bible, in the very Word of God; which is the greate≈øt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Soveraign Honour.</hi> Nay, in ≈øome of their Bibles you ≈øhall find <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ≈øtand in the very next Leaf to the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60861:28"/>which what is it, Beloved, but a <hi>Defiance</hi> to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond?</hi> Whereas the Papi≈øts being more mode≈øt than to affront it, have put it away far from them. <hi>But this is not all, my Brethren, for they pray to their Pictures; for if you but look over their Shoulders, you'l ≈øee their Pictures in the very heat of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, under their very Eyes, in the Leaves of their Common-Prayer Books; And therefore, mark me now Beloved, if we mu≈øt believe our own Sen≈øes, they pray to the Pictures,</hi> and to the Leaves, and to the Idol Common-Prayer Books and all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed had been ≈øomething like, and would have pieced well with what follows, that our <hi>Altars have their Images too, and that in a more profane way than the Papi≈øts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Well; but let us ≈øuppo≈øe our Church bound to an≈øwer for the≈øe <hi>Pictures;</hi> and for <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. Are we enjoyned to pay them any Wor≈øhip, as they of the Romi≈øh Communion are obliged to pay to their Images? The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>That due Honour and Veneration mu≈øt be given to Images, and that the Honour which is given to them is referred to the Things which they repre≈øent.</hi> Has the Church of <hi>England</hi> done any thing like this? We read of ≈øeveral Prayers u≈øed at the <hi>Con≈øecration</hi> of Images among≈øt them: But whoever heard of any ≈øuch thing practi≈øed at the ≈øetting up of <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> and <hi>Aaron?</hi> We know that they walk many Miles in Pilgrimage to particular Images, and that they think much more good is to be expected from ≈øome, than from others: But who ever thought ≈øo among us, or imagined that the Pictures of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> were more to be honoured than tho≈øe in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60861:28"/>
                  <hi>Wood≈øtreet,</hi> or in any other place? So that how ≈øilly ≈øoever the <hi>Zealous Brother</hi> may appear to be in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us, upon ≈øuch frivolous grounds, the wor≈øhip of Images; I am ≈øure that he who made the Harangue for him, is either much more ≈øo, or ≈øomething that is wor≈øe, in pretending that when we urge the ≈øame again≈øt the Papi≈øts, the Rea≈øons we go upon are no better than his.</p>
               <p>But we do at lea≈øt <hi>make Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> which the <hi>≈øecond Commandment expre≈øly forbids,</hi> as he makes his Brother ≈øay. And now a Rea≈øon of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerer is produced, that <hi>no Intention can alter the nature of Actions which are determined by a Divine Law.</hi> I would therefore know of him, whether there be, or be not good rea≈øon to make us certain, that the ≈øecond Commandment does not ab≈øolutely forbid the making of Images and Pictures, but only with reference to wor≈øhipping them. If there be no good Rea≈øon for it, let him then tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Intention can ju≈øtify the making of Images again≈øt an ab≈øolute Law to the contrary. If there be, let him then but confe≈øs what he thinks of this Objection that he has put into his Brother's Mouth; and there's one labour ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>I confe≈øs, it were not ill for him if ≈øome <hi>Intention</hi> might ju≈øtify the breaking of the ninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for he pretends that the <hi>New</hi> Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Books do not <hi>profe≈øs that hatred</hi> to <hi>Image-Wor≈øhip,</hi> which the <hi>Old</hi> ones did: When in the <hi>Commination</hi> to which he refers, the very fir≈øt in≈øtance runs thus; <hi>Cur≈øed is the Man that maketh any carved or molten Image to wor≈øhip it.</hi> Does he think that his <hi>Di≈ø≈øenting Brother</hi> mu≈øt an≈øwer for the≈øe things.</p>

Or does our Praying upon St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Day, that by <hi>God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment his holy Angels may ≈øuccour and defend us,</hi> come near even ≈øo much as to one ≈øingle <hi>Holy Michael Pray for us?</hi> which Form of Words, tho much inferiour to what is ≈øometimes u≈øed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we never dare to venture upon, becau≈øe we cannot make Addre≈ø≈øes either to him, or to any other Angel or Saint, but by interpretation we mu≈øt a≈øcribe the Divine Attribute of Omnipre≈øence to them, and for many other Rea≈øons, which yet we have not been able to get an An≈øwer to from the≈øe Men.

Had this been con≈øidered by the Repre≈øenter, his Brothers <hi>Zeal</hi> might well have been ≈øpared in ≈øaying, <hi>They may ≈øay, they do not pay Religious Wor≈øhip to the Bread and Wine, and Honour the Sacrament as God: But what, mu≈øt we not believe our ≈øen≈øes in ≈øo plain a Ca≈øe?</hi> Or el≈øe his Zeal ≈øhould not have ≈øtopt here, but carried him a little farther, to appeal to his <hi>own Eyes</hi> that we honour the <hi>Patin</hi> and <hi>Chalice</hi> as Gods too, by <hi>falling down to them on our Knees,</hi> for this is as <hi>plain a Ca≈øe</hi> as the other; and our Church has made no <hi>Declaration</hi> again≈øt it in ≈øolemn and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Terms neither, as it has again≈øt the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine.</hi> But I gue≈øs that the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Brother</hi> when he is once at liberty to ≈øpeak for him≈øelf, will confe≈øs that he <hi>≈øees</hi> neither the one nor the other; and that it is no affront to his <hi>Eyes</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us of Adoring the Sacrament, and to yield that when we receive it, we Adore God and him only, in a po≈øture which as we think, well becomes the thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Receivers of ≈øuch Holy My≈øteries.</p>
               <p>However, tho we, it ≈øeems, mu≈øt not be believed when we ≈øay that <hi>we do not adore</hi> the Sacrament at all; yet we will not be ≈øo hard to the Church of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60861:30"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> but believe her telling us that ≈øhe <hi>does Adore</hi> the Sacrament, and that <hi>with Divine Honour too.</hi> And when the <hi>Zealous Brother</hi> gets our Church at any Advantage like this, or can find out any practices among≈øt us like tho≈øe above mentioned, we ≈øhall hear him, I doubt not, ≈øpeaking to better purpo≈øe for him≈øelf, than as his <hi>Brother</hi> here has taught him.</p>
               <p>And now, I think, I have omitted nothing in the fir≈øt <hi>Five</hi> of the <hi>Fifteen Parallels,</hi> that required the lea≈øt notice, but have rather ventured being laugh'd at by the Repre≈øenter for giving any ≈øerious An≈øwers, where he meant only to <hi>Ridicule.</hi> But by this he may ≈øee what little rea≈øon there was to Crow over his Adver≈øary as he does upon this occa≈øion; which was all that I intended. And therefore ≈øince it is needle≈øs to <hi>drive</hi> the <hi>Parallel</hi> any farther with that circum≈øtance which I have hitherto u≈øed; I mu≈øt not do a needle≈øs thing, which according to one of his weighty Ob≈øervations, <hi>would be Six-pence a piece more for the Curious:</hi> E≈øpecially ≈øince the An≈øwerer has done Rea≈øon enough to the remaining Particulars. For tho the Repre≈øenter, to ≈øave him≈øelf from any further Reply, comes off with telling him that he an≈øwered the whole charge with, <hi>The Di≈ø≈øenters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charged us with this or that, &amp;c.</hi> and nothing el≈øe; yet the Reader will find more ≈øaid than this comes to, if he will con≈øult the An≈øwer it ≈øelf, in≈øtead of taking the Repre≈øenters word. But I hope <hi>Five</hi> of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars have been handled his own way: And now I offer him this, either in full Satisfaction, or in part of Payment; let him chu≈øe, as he likes, 'tis all one to his Humble Servant. And therefore if he will plea≈øe to call upon me for Arrears, I promi≈øe him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60861:31"/>that our <hi>calling upon the Birds, the Bea≈øts, and the Fi≈øhes,</hi> ≈øhall not be forgotten, nor <hi>our crying out to Dead Men, in our mo≈øt ≈øolemn Devotion,</hi> nor the <hi>Apochrypha</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> nor the <hi>Rochet,</hi> the <hi>Alb,</hi> and the <hi>Tunicle,</hi> nor any thing el≈øe which yet wants a <hi>Vindication,</hi> as he ≈øays: But, to return him one of his familiar Phra≈øes, I ≈øhall <hi>take occa≈øion of playing him the ≈øame Tune over again as di≈øtinctly</hi> upon the remaining <hi>Ten,</hi> as he has had it already upon his fir≈øt <hi>Five</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>And now let us go on with his Reply; in which the next thing I ob≈øerve, is, that he will needs have the An≈øwerer to <hi>bid fair for the good opinion</hi> of Di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and <hi>to curry clo≈øely with the</hi> Di≈ø≈øenters, and to <hi>throw tho≈øe ≈øcandals upon his own Church in good earne≈øt,<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> which the Repre≈øenter did little more than in je≈øt.</hi> If the Repre≈øenter could have turned his Adver≈øaries Pen again≈øt the <hi>Di≈ø≈øenters,</hi> there are ≈øome would have had a better opportunity of <hi>currying clo≈øely with the Di≈ø≈øenters;</hi> and I ≈øhall tell him who they are, before I have done with him. But, it ≈øeems, we are not for doing every good thing, in the very nick when he would have it done. And ≈øo to be revenged on us, we mu≈øt be repre≈øented as <hi>currying with the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters;</hi> which yet we are as far from, when we own our Agreement with them in tho≈øe many things, which they no le≈øs than we, object again≈øt the Papi≈øts; as from <hi>currying with the Papi≈øts,</hi> when we confe≈øs that we agree with them in tho≈øe fewer things that are to be objected again≈øt the Di≈ø≈øenters. And yet <hi>currying</hi> with the Di≈ø≈øenters is not ≈øo great a Fault, but he could tell them upon the Spot, how their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are at an end, <hi>now our Churches power has been
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60861:31"/>≈øomething check'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> which he thinks they may <hi>Reflect upon.</hi> But if the Repre≈øenter would win their good opinion, he ≈øhould of all things beware of putting them in mind to <hi>Reflect;</hi> le≈øt when they begin to Reflect upon tho≈øe things of which he ≈øpeaks, they ≈øhould chance to Reflect upon other things of which he ≈øpeaks not.</p>
               <p>Me thinks too, I may rea≈øonably ≈øu≈øpect a little currying of the Repre≈øenter in what comes next. For, whereas the An≈øwerer thought the Di≈ø≈øenters <hi>too wi≈øe and cautious to take Characters</hi> [of us] <hi>from</hi> [Their own] <hi>open and profe≈ø≈øed Enemies;</hi> (for that was his plain meaning) the Repre≈øenter under≈øtands him, as if he had meant <hi>our, i.e.</hi> the Church of <hi>Englands profe≈øt Enemies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> and then hopes that our People will henceforth be ≈øo wi≈øe, as not to take Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Popery from us, who are, as he ≈øays, <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to Papi≈øts. But whether he was re≈øolved to make this mi≈øtake for the ≈øake of the neat Turn, or to ≈øave him≈øelf from ≈øaying whether he was <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Di≈ø≈øenters, I leave him to re≈øolve. But I hope he does not expect that I ≈øhould take notice of every ≈øuch little Reflection, as he knows this to be.</p>
               <p>And yet I mu≈øt needs vindicate the An≈øwerer from that Charge, that whereas the Repre≈øenter granted, that his Prote≈øtant Character of a Papi≈øt was not made up <hi>wholly</hi> of down-right Lies, the An≈øwerer <hi>≈øtretches this Courte≈øy with a witne≈øs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 9. Pag. 10.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that we have the Repre≈øenter's word for it now that we are guilty of no Mi≈ørepre≈øentation at all of matters of Fact, which he, the Repre≈øenter, never did, nor will allow. But in this the An≈øwerer is wronged, who very well remembred, that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60861:32"/>did a little di≈øpute his Churches owning the <hi>Depo≈øing Power,</hi> and two or three Points more, which he thought fit to drop at la≈øt. Now therefore, as the An≈øwerer had frequently ≈øaid before, that the matters of Fact were the ≈øame in both Characters, <hi>very few things excepted;</hi> ≈øo in his la≈øt An≈øwer, he was to be under≈øtood in cour≈øe with the ≈øame Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that we now had our Adver≈øaries Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, that in the Character of a Mi≈ørepre≈øented Papi≈øt, there were no Prote≈øtant Mi≈ørepre≈øentations of Popery properly ≈øo called; and ≈øo, that a very few Points excepted, we are agreed on both ≈øides upon the matters of Fact. And this one would think was plain enough in the la≈øt An≈øwer, where the An≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thus interprets the Conce≈ø≈øion of his Adver≈øary. <hi>Whatever he at fir≈øt pretended, he grants now, that we are not in a ≈øtrict and proper ≈øen≈øe Mi≈ørepre≈øenters; and thus farewel to Character-making, ≈øince Papi≈øts and Prote≈øtants that under≈øtand the≈øe matters, <label type="milestone">

               <p>I know indeed the Repre≈øenter would extend the <hi>down-right Lies,</hi> from which he does not ab≈øolutely acquit us, to more In≈øtances than tho≈øe excepted, by the An≈øwerer. For which he appeals to his own Character of a Papi≈øt mi≈ørepre≈øented, where he has repre≈øented the Prote≈øtants as Liars, in charging the Papi≈øts with other things di≈øowned by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Which is one of the fine≈øt Fetches that is po≈ø≈øible. For tho in that Character, he has made the Prote≈øtant to charge the Papi≈øt with all that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed charge him with; yet he has made him do
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60861:32"/>more, and therefore might ≈øafely appeal to his own Character, to prove that we are <hi>Liars</hi> in <hi>≈øome</hi> things; always ≈øuppo≈øing that he is the hone≈øte≈øt Man in the World, in repre≈øenting the Prote≈øtant Repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Popery. But how often mu≈øt he be told, that he has been a fal≈øe Repre≈øenter of us as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? That he ≈øometimes brings in Prote≈øtants char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Papi≈øts, (1.) In ambiguous Terms, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of different Interpretations; for in≈øtance, under the Head of <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> which is the fir≈øt Point he mentions. (2.) With owning the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Con≈øequences of their Doctrines and Practices, as that Papi≈øts <hi>do believe their Sins to be infalliby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon Ab≈øolution, whether they re≈øolve upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment or no:</hi> which is his ≈øecond In≈øtance, and there are two or three more, to the ≈øame Tune. (3.) With ≈øome things that we do not impute to 'em at all, either as Principles or Con≈øequences; witne≈øs that In≈øtance which he has the fore-head ≈øtill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt upon. <hi>For,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>Are their Sermons in Latin? Do they teach in unknown Tongues?</hi> as if we charged them with this. I know not what every Prote≈øtant in the World may have ≈øaid in his heat again≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts: But I am apt to think that it will be as hard to find a Prote≈øtant that hath ≈øaid this again≈øt them, as to find a <hi>Zealous Brother</hi> that will own the Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermon he hath made again≈øt us. Upon one or other of the≈øe three accounts he might well appeal to his own Characters to convict us of Lyihg, and ask the An≈øwerer <hi>what he thinks</hi> of this, or that which Prote≈øtants charge upon Papi≈øts; ≈øuppo≈øing, as I ≈øaid before, that he delivers <hi>Oracles</hi> always, when the is ≈øetting us out to the World.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60861:33"/>
               <p>And now, I ≈øay, 'tis too late for the Repre≈øenter to ask us, <hi>what we think</hi> of the≈øe things; becau≈øe, not to mention the ≈øecond An≈øwer, his fir≈øt An≈øwerer has told him very particularly what <hi>we think</hi> of them, what we do charge them with, and what not. And ≈øince he has ≈øaid nothing to it, it is unrea≈øonable to expect that we ≈øhould do the ≈øame thing over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, as often as he is plea≈øed to put the Que≈øtion to us. As for <hi>firing the City,</hi> and <hi>killing</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> &amp;c. what have the≈øe things to do in the Character of Popery? I ≈øuppo≈øe 'tis no Article of the Repre≈øenter's Faith; that Papi≈øts did not the≈øe things; I am ≈øure 'tis none of mine, that they did.</p>
               <p>Having upon no better grounds than the≈øe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the An≈øwerer of Mi≈ørepre≈øenting him, he runs out into general and pa≈ø≈øionate Expo≈øtulations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inju≈øtice of tho≈øe who <hi>for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt</hi> ≈øupport the fal≈øe Notions which the People have of Popery, le≈øt <hi>them≈øelves ≈øhould appear the Deceivers.</hi> At length he asks, whether altho <hi>the People mu≈øt be preached into a Dread of Popery, it be a Chri≈øtian Method to make u≈øe of Artifices to encrea≈øe the Horror?<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> Why ≈øhould every thing the Papi≈øts do be ≈øtretch'd and ≈øtrain'd, and forc'd to make it ugly?‚Äî 'Tis true, this is proper enough to win upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, who make no di≈øtinction between Real and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Mon≈øters; 'tis well enough, where the Intere≈øt is be≈øt maintain'd by the madne≈øs of the People. But where's the Chri≈øtianity all the while, where's Truth and Charity?</hi> Why truly not ≈øo much as there ≈øhould be, where either the≈øe things are done on the one ≈øide, or fal≈øly ≈øaid to be done on the order. Now it mu≈øt not be quite forgotten that the Repre≈øenter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60861:33"/>wrote his Prote≈øtant Characters of Popery, as they lay in his own and the Peoples Heads; and made all his An≈øwerers work in di≈øtingui≈øhing between <hi>Repre≈øentation</hi> and <hi>Di≈øpute;</hi> between Principles that are <hi>owned,</hi> and Con≈øequences that are <hi>denied</hi> by the Papi≈øts, utterly u≈øele≈øs; becau≈øe things did not and could not lie thus di≈øtinctly in the <hi>Peoples</hi> Heads. For In≈øtance, Becau≈øe if a Preacher ≈øhould ≈øay that though the Papi≈øts think it lawful to wor≈øhip Images, yet it is plainly forbidden in God's Word ≈øo to do, and that too as an Idolatrous Action; the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pre≈øently conclude, that the Papi≈øts believing it to be Idolatry, differ from us in no other thing, but that we think Idolatry, and forbidden Wor≈øhip, to be unlawful, and the Papi≈øts do not think ≈øo. But if the Repre≈øenter believed this of the People; <hi>Where was Chri≈øtianity, where was Truth and Charity,</hi> when he wrote his Repre≈øentation of Popery, under colour of di≈øabu≈øing the People; and made one part of a Papi≈øt's Character to be this, that he abhors Idolatry? for thus the People would he betrayed into a belief, that he does not ≈øo much as wor≈øhip Images; for <hi>Con≈øequents</hi> and <hi>Antecedents</hi> are ≈øo jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Peoples Heads, that nothing can <hi>lie di≈øtinctly</hi> there. We indeed do not think ≈øo meanly of them, and therefore might hone≈øtly urge <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Con≈øequences</hi> again≈øt that and other <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But he, it ≈øeems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they could not di≈øtingui≈øh between the one and the other; and then I am ≈øure if they acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Papi≈øts of the <hi>Con≈øequence,</hi> it would go hard if they did not acquit them of the <hi>Fact</hi> too; and therefore whether he put the Denying of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60861:34"/>into the Papi≈øt's Character with an hone≈øt De≈øign, at lea≈øt, whether he had any rea≈øon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject again≈øt the di≈øtinct proceeding of the An≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, I dare almo≈øt now appeal to him≈øelf. But, as I ob≈øerved before, the An≈øwerer made him a≈øhamed of imputing this kind of <hi>madne≈øs</hi> to the People, and ≈øo we heard no more of it in his next Reply. But yet the <hi>Intere≈øt</hi> we are ≈øaid to have in the People mu≈øt ≈øtill be imputed to their <hi>madne≈øs.</hi> And what <hi>madne≈øs</hi> is it now? Why they <hi>cannot di≈øtingui≈øh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Real and Artificial Mon≈øters:</hi> Which is as much as to ≈øay, that we have made the Papi≈øts <hi>Mon≈øters,</hi> by telling notorious Lies of them; and the People are ≈øo mad that they cannot find it out. But may not I take my turn now to ask, <hi>Where's Chri≈øtianity all this while; where's Truth and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> Why mu≈øt we be branded with the Imputation of Fal≈øhood and Calumny, and our Chri≈øtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren treated in that manner, as if they were mere ≈øtupid Creatures, and more fit to herd with Bea≈øts; than to live among≈øt Men?</p>
               <p>As for our ≈øelves being thus urged, we beg leave to appeal to All that know us, whether this odious Character be any way ≈øuitable to our Conver≈øation; and then, whether we have de≈øerved it for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this Controver≈øy in particular, we appeal to the World. We appeal to all Men of Sincerity and Under≈øtanding, what colour of Rea≈øon the Repre≈øenter had here to ask, Why <hi>praying to Images, leave to Sin for Mony, Forgivene≈øs without Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>≈øhould be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged again≈øt them to make them the Object of Hatred, and the Subject of popular Fury?</hi> Have not his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerers more than once publi≈øhed clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60861:34"/>what we do, and what we do not charge them with in every one of the≈øe Re≈øpects? Has he convinced them of any In≈øincerity, nay, of any mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the ≈øtating of the≈øe things? Has he taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing they have ≈øaid about them? Why would he not be brought to confe≈øs the Ju≈øtice of our charging them ≈øo far as we have done, and our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice to them in charging them no farther, or at lea≈øt to confute us by ≈øhewing wherein we had done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly? What other Con≈øtruction now can <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> make of the≈øe Proceedings, but that he would not confe≈øs that we do them no wrong, and yet could not prove that we do? But then certainly he ≈øhould at lea≈øt have been ≈øilent, and not go on as he does to declaim again≈øt us; as if he really believed we were tho≈øe odious Mi≈ørepre≈øenters and Fal≈øifiers, which he would have the World believe that we are.</p>
               <p>He ≈øays indeed, that the An≈øwerer <hi>unhappily takes it to him≈øelf, as if He and His were arraigned of Lying and Calumny,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereas the Repre≈øenter ≈øpoke only in general, without ≈øo much as hinting upon any party or per≈øon in particular.</hi> But ≈øurely when after the fir≈øt An≈øwer that was made in behalf of the Church, of <hi>England,</hi> the Repre≈øenter without telling us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars why, could yet declare that he would <hi>be a Turk as ≈øoon as a Papi≈øt, if the An≈øwerer had rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented Popery;</hi> we mu≈øt have as little under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he allows to the <hi>Mobile,</hi> not to find that we are principally intended in the≈øe general Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He thinks the An≈øwerers <hi>over ≈øollicitude to prove his Innocence,</hi> may in ≈øome <hi>breed a ≈øu≈øpicion</hi> of his Guilt. But whether it be Innocence or Guilt that makes us ≈øollicitous to clear our ≈øelves, we may now
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60861:35"/>leave the World to judg. One thing, I take it, is ea≈øy to be di≈øcerned, that tho our Adver≈øary Rowls in Figures to heighten the inju≈øtice under which <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His</hi> have ≈øuffered by Mi≈ørepre≈øentations, yet he throws the Guilt ≈øo faintly upon the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as if he were con≈øcious of being unju≈øt to us all the while.</p>
               <p>As for the People of our Communion, whom he complements under the Title of the <hi>Mobile,</hi> we may ≈øay without vanity, that how ≈øcornfully ≈øoever the Repre≈øenter treats them, we ≈øhall never be a≈øhamed to compare them with their Neighbours; and that it would be a better World for the Repre≈øenter, if they were as ignorant and ≈øtupid as he would have them thought to be.</p>
               <p>But no more of what he has ≈øaid in this fit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for here's a ≈øudden change, and now behold him the gaye≈øt and merrie≈øt Man alive. He fancies the An≈øwerer left him to wonder who tho≈øe <hi>We</hi> are that <hi>are not Mi≈ørepre≈øenters in a ≈øtrict and proper notion of Mi≈ørepre≈øenting, i.e.</hi> who do not belye the Papi≈øts. For indeed he <hi>would gladly know who tho≈øe We</hi> are, <hi>that he might return them his thanks for this ≈øo kind Office‚Äî Did he but know the Men, he would never permit them to lye ob≈øcured under the general name of</hi> We. No, <hi>he would particularize them to the World‚Äî For why? are not ≈øuch Men Prodigies of Truth, Hone≈øty, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice? ‚Äî Men that never mi≈ørepre≈øented the Papi≈øts! Why the≈øe are admirable Men indeed, and not to be heard of every day!</hi> Now really this, with all that belongs to it, is allowed to be very well for the kind, and ≈øo much the better, becau≈øe it more and more appears, that tho he can be angry without a cau≈øe, yet a ≈ømall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60861:35"/>matter will plea≈øe him again.

               <p>For, was it not the <hi>Repre≈øenter</hi> that would be <hi>glad to know</hi> who the≈øe Men are that do <hi>not mi≈ørepre≈øent Papi≈øts, the≈øe Admirable Men that are not to be heard of every day;</hi> the≈øe Men, that <hi>were he but a≈ø≈øured of the Being of ≈øuch Men,</hi> he <hi>≈øhould begin to think</hi> A≈øtrea <hi>was returned again!</hi> Did he not wi≈øh to know them, that he might <hi>particularize them to the World,</hi> nay and <hi>have their Names Blazoned in every Sheet upon Pillars erected to their Memory?</hi> Yes ≈øurely, this was the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenter</hi> him≈øelf. Why then, Dear Sir, be happy and joyful, for many ≈øuch <hi>Admirable Men,</hi> as the≈øe, <hi>are in being</hi> I a≈ø≈øure you, and <hi>to be heard of every day;</hi> But becau≈øe it will be too great a charge to <hi>erect Pillars</hi> for 'em All, I ≈øhall at pre≈øent recommend but two of 'em to your Acquaintance, who are already <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized to the World,</hi> by the Names of the <hi>Fir≈øst</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> An≈øwerers to <hi>A Papi≈øt Mi≈ørepre≈øented and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented.</hi> What pity is it that ≈øuch Friends ≈øhould be <hi>ob≈øcured</hi> ≈øo long <hi>under the general Name of</hi> We, and be no better known to one another? The≈øe, Sir, are the Men whom you de≈øire to honour, as if they were made on purpo≈øe for it. For why? Tho very hone≈øt, Gentlemen they are, and their Words may go for as great a matter, yet they have a notable Quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, never to think of <hi>Repre≈øenting</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without <hi>proving</hi> what they ≈øay. Why, Sir,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60861:36"/>they have been lately tryed upon no le≈øs than <hi>Thirty</hi> and <hi>Seven</hi> Points of <hi>Popery;</hi> and have born the Te≈øt of a ≈øevere, watchful, double-dealing Adver≈øary; and one as vehemently de≈øirous to find fal≈øe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters among Prote≈øtants, as you can be to know the true ones. Now, Sir, judg if the≈øe two are not likely to prove Right and True Men: For the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary is to this day roaming up and down among≈øt other Mens Books to get Prote≈øtant Mi≈ørepre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them to An≈øwer; a plain ≈øign, you will ≈øay, that he has found none of their own to call them to an Account for. And ≈øo having found out your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Men for you, I wish you much joy of one another.</p>
               <p>Now this is too Blunt, I confe≈øs, to go for <hi>Railery;</hi> but 'tis <hi>True</hi> tho, and that's almo≈øt as good: And the Repre≈øenter may ≈øee by it how another would have handled him upon this matter, if he had not by good fortune fal'n in my way. It is to me a mo≈øt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable thing, why the Repre≈øenter ≈øhould ≈øearch for more and more Mi≈ørepre≈øentations, Mi≈øquotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ≈øuch like faults in Prote≈øtant Authors, and for≈øake the Defence of his own double Characters, if indeed he thinks they may be defended: But if he does not think ≈øo, it were but an hone≈øt Mans part to confe≈øs it, and then I think the Controver≈øy were at an end. Certainly the de≈øign of his fir≈øt Book, which he ≈øtill pretends to vindicate, was to give us an account of the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon which ≈øcore he took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf the Title of a Repre≈øenter. 'Tis true he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to di≈øpute for them too; but that de≈øign fell to the ground upon the fir≈øt Attempt that was made
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60861:37"/>upon him, and I believe he will hardly ≈øtoop to take it up again. But then to illu≈øtrate the Repre≈øenting part, he ≈øhewed on the other ≈øide how Prote≈øtants, as he ≈øays, have Mi≈ørepre≈øented Papi≈øts. So that here was a ≈øolemn Controver≈øy begun upon ≈øo many ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral points, about Repre≈øenting and Mi≈ørepre≈øenting; and it was, one would think, very fairly carried on by the Fir≈øt An≈øwerer, who we know went on with the Repre≈øenter from point to point, di≈øcovering, where need was, his Ambiguities and Fallacies on both ≈øides, mending his Characters, and giving a correct and plain account of the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in oppo≈øition to that lame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful account thereof. which the Repre≈øenter had publi≈øhed. The ≈øum of the performance was to ≈øhew how much and no more we ab≈øolutely charge upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in matters of charge not ≈øo clear as the re≈øt, how far and no farther we accu≈øe them; every Particular being guarded with rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs and Te≈øtimonies. They ≈øecond An≈øwerer perceiving into what mi≈øtakes the Repre≈øenter was wandring, by confounding the proper Subject of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation, with Subjects of Di≈øpute, went as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly through all the points, and plainly di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed tho≈øe things under every one. Now would not any Man of common ≈øen≈øe imagine, that, if the Di≈øpute were pertinently carried on, the Que≈øtion mu≈øt be this, Who gave the true≈øt account of the Faith and Wor≈øhip of the Church <hi>Rome,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenter, or the An≈øwerer? And if it were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently managed, that this Que≈øtion mu≈øt be driven through all the <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Points, as it has been done once and again on our behalf. And, therefore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60861:37"/>to what end the Repre≈øenter ≈øhould trouble him≈øelf to find out new Repre≈øentations in the Books of other Prote≈øtants, a Man may well wonder for a while, tho at la≈øt he will ≈øettle upon the true Rea≈øon, that the Repre≈øenter was Sick of defending his own.</p>
               <p>If it be ≈øaid, that one part of his bu≈øine≈øs at lea≈øt, goes forwards ≈øtill, which was to ≈øhew, that ≈øome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants have been Mi≈ørepre≈øenters; I de≈øire it may be con≈øidered too, whether this was not in order to the ≈øetling of a clear and indi≈øputable account between us, what are, and what are not the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Points. For granting now, (and 'tis a good large Grant to be made at once) that the Repre≈øenter did ≈øincerely give in his own former Prote≈øtant thoughts of Popery, and (as far as he could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them) tho≈øe apprehen≈øions what Popery is, which lay in the Heads of the Vulgar; then ≈øo far as the An≈øwerers confe≈ø≈øed this was not a true Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if Prote≈øtants did thus charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øo far I ≈øay they complied with the Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters de≈øign, which was to correct ≈øuch, if there were any ≈øuch mi≈øtakes going among≈øt Prote≈øtants. But ≈øo far as they owned the charge in the Prote≈øtant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to be good again≈øt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the Repre≈øenter di≈øowned it, he had in this ca≈øe nothing to do, but to confute their Te≈øtimonies, and to ≈øhew that in tho≈øe particulars as well as in others, his <hi>Church</hi> was Mi≈ørepre≈øented. And therefore if he had been ≈øincere, the Controver≈øy had proceeded thus on his ≈øide; and nothing could have diverted him from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this manner, if he had been able to make any thing of it. But in≈øtead of this, he has for some
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60861:38"/>time for≈øaken his <hi>Thirty and Seven Chapters,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him≈øelf in turning over ≈øome Books of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants, to find out ≈øuch Sayings as he thinks there is any colour to call <hi>Mi≈ørepre≈øentations;</hi> nay, he is fal'n ≈øo low as to pick out what <hi>Mi≈øquotations</hi> of Authors he can find among≈øt them, and to tax them here and there for Hi≈øtorical Pa≈ø≈øages.</p>
               <p>But did ever either of his Adver≈øaries undertake to ju≈øtify all that any Prote≈øtant Divine, or Hi≈øtorian has at any time ≈øaid in oppo≈øition to Popery? Or, was it not po≈ø≈øible to give a more hone≈øt account of Popery than he did, to di≈øcover his fallacious way, of repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own Church, and the true ≈øtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions that have been hitherto di≈øputed, without ≈øuch an undertaking? Nay have not his An≈øwerers effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done it, without any ≈øuch undertaking? ≈øo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually that he has for≈øaken the defence of his double Characters under the <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Points? Why then mu≈øt they be bound to An≈øwer for all that every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant has ≈øaid again≈øt the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Will he an≈øwer for all the Popi≈øh Mi≈ørepre≈øentations of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants, that I can bring before him? I ≈øhall try him a little as to this before I have done: And I think with ≈øome better Grace, than this Task has been put upon us withal. For if it be but a mean way of carrying on the Controver≈øy, as I confe≈øs it is, yet he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us to it by in≈øi≈øting upon it ≈øo ob≈øtinately, that we have now no other way to let him ≈øee the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of it, but by turning it upon him≈øelf. And, which is ≈øomething too, we have cleared our Hands of him as to the Original Controver≈øy, for he has dropt that quite away, and ≈øo having no Arrears to be reproached with, we may hand≈øomly enough talk
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60861:38"/>with him upon this new Score; and I will venture before-hand to ≈øay thus much, that he is likely to be as deep in our Debt for this, as he is for his fir≈øt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us. Nor am I afraid thus to ≈øpeak may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in this matter, tho he ≈øeems to have taken up a way of writing now, that will not fail him in ha≈øte; for as long as he can but find out any new ≈øevere Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Prote≈øtants again≈øt Popery, 'tis but furni≈øhing out a new Book with 'em, and he may as well call it by the Title of a Fifth or a Sixth Vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, as by any other Title what≈øoever. Nay the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication will go forward, if he can but find out a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Head</hi> without a Name, to ≈øay that he believes the Popi≈øh Sermons are in a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nknown Tongue,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing as extravagant as that.</p>
               <p>But tho it be no part of bu≈øine≈øs to bring off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that has been ≈øaid or done by Prote≈øtants, yet I ≈øhall a little examine what our Repre≈øenter has charged tho≈øe with, whom he has ≈øingled out to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe them to the World. For I am much mi≈øtaken if even here, he has not expo≈øed him≈øelf a great deal more than any Body el≈øe: Since he does often take the liberty to fill up his Tragical Declamations again≈øt Prote≈øtants, by ≈øpiteful Con≈øtructions, weak Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and now and then by fal≈øe Accu≈øations, which is never more intollerable, than when a Man is in the ≈øame Breath exclaiming again≈øt the Mi≈ørepre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others. For my own part, where his Accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in whole or in part fall ju≈øtly, there ≈øhall they lye for me, nor will I make another Man's Fault my own by going about to defend it. And if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ≈øame care not to make him≈øelf Guilty, by accu≈øing the Innocent, he had come off better upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60861:39"/>this Theme of Arraigning particular Men, as wild as it is.</p>
               <p>He begins fir≈øst with <hi>Sutcliffs Inference</hi> from <hi>Aquinas,</hi> which I confe≈ø≈ø is a very ≈øilly one; tho I think it had been not only for <hi>Sutcliffs</hi> credit that this matter had been let alone, but for <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s too, who≈øe Principle is no very wi≈øe one. But I ≈øee no rea≈øon why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerer ≈øhould have been <hi>a≈øhamed to print it over again,</hi> ≈øince he did it only to ≈øhew that <hi>Sutcliff</hi> inferred his Accu≈øation by Con≈øequence from what an Author of their own had ≈øaid, but not to ju≈øtify the Inference. And for any thing the An≈øwerer has ≈øaid, the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenter is at liberty to go on with his charge of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> again≈øt <hi>him that drew the Con≈øequence,</hi> to call him a <hi>Fool</hi> in this bu≈øine≈øs, if he believed the Con≈øequence to be Good, or a <hi>Knave</hi> if he did not.</p>
               <p>But I would gladly know how the Repre≈øenter can clear him≈øelf from gro≈øs. Mi≈ørepre≈øentation in the next In≈øtance, where falling upon the Author of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenting Catechi≈øm</hi> for charging them with praying to Images,<note place="margin">P. 19.</note> he makes it to be a Crime, which his fir≈øt An≈øwerer had cleared them from in ≈øaying, that we do not <hi>charge</hi> them <hi>with praying to Images without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Re≈øpect.</hi> For many not a Man <hi>pray to Images,</hi> and yet not pray to them <hi>without any further Re≈øpect?</hi> This would make one believe that he writes only for the <hi>Mobile,</hi> in who≈øe Heads things cannot <hi>lye di≈øtinctly.</hi> But 'tis not ≈øo hone≈øt tho, e≈øpecially in a Man that complains of Mi≈ørepre≈øentations.

I do acknowledg that tho≈øe Words cited by the Repre≈øenter are in <hi>E≈øtius;</hi> but tho I cannot ≈øay whether the Dr. minded them or not, yet I believe it will either way appear, that the Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had but little rea≈øon to make this an In≈øtance of our <hi>endeavouring to prove ≈øome Folly upon the Papi≈øts, out of their own Authors, and then bringing in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors quite contrary to their own ≈øen≈øe and words. E≈øtius</hi> concludes that the <hi>Fire</hi> which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. is the <hi>Fire of the Day of Judgment,</hi> which ≈øhall <hi>prove</hi> every Mans work, and <hi>purge that which is not already purged.</hi> And at length he comes to ≈øpeak of the <hi>Purgatory of Souls after this Life, which ≈øeems not only not to be ≈øupported, but to be overthrown al≈øo by this place of the Apo≈øtle, ≈øince the whole purgation is re≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60861:41"/>to the la≈øt Judgment.</hi> To this he an≈øwers, that <hi>thus much is manife≈øt again≈øt the Sectaries, from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the place, that in the World to come ≈øome Sins are to be forgiven,</hi> viz. <hi>theirs who ≈øhall be purged and ≈øaved by Fire. Nor,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>does it follow from the Purgatory Fire of the la≈øt day, that no Purgatory of Souls is left before that day, any more than it follows from the Purgatory of Souls, that there is no purging in this Life;</hi> which, allowing for the principles of his Church, is with the re≈øt that follows to this purpo≈øe, a good and ≈øolid An≈øwer to the fore≈øaid Objection. And this was the Doctor's Ground for ≈øaying, that <hi>E≈øtius contends that it cannot be concluded from hence that there is no Purgatory.</hi> But then he goes on, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, we mu≈øt know that as the Scripture often leaves a particular Judgment to be under≈øtood, under a general Judgment, and from the la≈øt day in which all ≈øhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will have the day of every ones Death to be under≈øtood in which each Man is judged by him≈øelf; ≈øo from the Fire that is to go before the Face of Chri≈øt at the general Judgment, and to purge what≈øoever at that time remains to be purged, it leaves a certain Fire to be under≈øtood, in which a particular Judgment is exerci≈øed for the purging of Souls pre≈øently after this Life.</hi> Then come in the words cited by the Repre≈øenter. <hi>Wherefore by this way the Puni≈øhment of Souls in Purgatory is well and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly gathered.</hi> But how is it <hi>well</hi> and <hi>solidly gathered</hi> this way? Does <hi>E≈øtius</hi> ≈øay that the puni≈øhment of Souls in Purgatory is implied in, or that it does any way follow from that general Purging which is to be at the Day of Judgment? No, he ≈øays not a word than looks this way; but only that one leaves the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be under≈øtood, that is to ≈øay, if a Man has a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60861:41"/>mind ≈øo to under≈øtand it, but not el≈øe. For 'tis a ≈øhame to repeat that, becau≈øe where the Scripture ≈øpeaks of a general Judgment, it ≈øuppo≈øes that we mu≈øt dye fir≈øt; therefore when it ≈øpeaks of a general Purgatory of Men, it leaves a Purgatory of Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand to be under≈øtood, or <hi>well and ≈øolidly gathered.</hi> But the Repre≈øenter will ≈øay, the Que≈øtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>E≈øtius</hi>'s way of <hi>gathering</hi> Purgatory from this Text, be good and ≈øolid; but whether <hi>E≈øtius</hi> does <hi>contend</hi> for no more than that Purgatory cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by it, as the Dean pretended. I grant this, to be the Que≈øtion, and it ≈øhall have an An≈øwer, if it has not had it already. Whether the Dean made the ≈øame ob≈øervation that I have made upon this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterious bu≈øine≈øs, I cannot certainly ≈øay, having never ≈øpoken with him about it: But I pre≈øume he did, becau≈øe it will clear him from any great matter of blame, in taking no notice of the Pa≈ø≈øage cited by the Repre≈øenter. The Ca≈øe in ≈øhort is this, <hi>E≈øtius</hi> was very clear in this Point, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not here <hi>≈øpeak of a Purgatory of Souls, but of that Fire which is to prove the works of. All at the day of Judgment.</hi> But then he mu≈øt guard him≈øelf as well as he could from the charge of interpreting this place, otherwi≈øe than the <hi>Latins</hi> had interpreted it at <hi>Florence;</hi> which made it nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to bring in his third Que≈øtion, <hi>An &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo probetur,</hi> whether and how it can be proved from this place, that there is a Purgatory for Souls after this Life, in pur≈øuance of which Que≈øtion he ≈øays what we have already cited. Now, although in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this Text, he could own, as he did, with great; mode≈øty and good rea≈øon, that he did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Bellarmine, Len≈øaeus, Vicus; Bonaventure</hi> in all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60861:42"/>things; yet when the Name of a Council lay cro≈øs to him, no other kind of mode≈øty would ≈øerve but ≈øome appearance at lea≈øt of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to it. And therefore ob≈øerving <hi>that the Latin Fathers thought that Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was to be e≈øtabli≈øhed upon this place, tho the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers di≈ø≈øented;</hi> he al≈øo <hi>thought</hi> it needful to <hi>gather</hi> it as <hi>well and ≈øolidly</hi> as he could, from this place too. For by that time he had done his be≈øt, <hi>proving</hi> was dwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>gathering;</hi> and to ≈øuch a way of gathering too, that, the premi≈øes being con≈øidered. I leave it to all impartial Men to con≈øider, whether ≈øo Judicious a Man as <hi>E≈øtius</hi> was, <hi>contended</hi> for the point; or rather if the mode≈øt <hi>E≈øtius,</hi> in the ≈øtrait he was in, did not choo≈øe to talk beneath him≈øelf, in compliance with the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers at <hi>Florence.</hi> So that at la≈øt we have here an Example of the Servitude of Ingenuous Minds in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but not of <hi>charging Folly upon the Papi≈øts out of their own Authors.</hi> For this was that which the Dean declined the doing of; whereas if he had ≈øaid, <hi>Nay, All that</hi> E≈øtius <hi>contends for from this place is, that it cannot be concluded from hence that there is no Purgatory, altho he makes a hard ≈øhift to avoid falling foul with the</hi> Florentine <hi>Council;</hi> here had then been no colour for accu≈øing him of Mi≈øquotation, it had al≈øo done his bu≈øine≈øs as well; only this had been to charge Folly upon <hi>E≈øtius,</hi> and upon the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers too, which it ≈øeems the Dean had no mind to do.</p>
               <p>I proceed next to his Charge upon the Author of <hi>The Devotions of the Church of Rome.</hi> And fir≈øt he accu≈øes him of quoting <hi>E≈øcobar</hi> for that which he does not ≈øay in the place cited; nay, <hi>there is not one word of it to be found in him there.</hi> Now to know whether this be ≈øo or not, it is but fair to take the whole Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60861:42"/>of that Author, for which he refers us to <hi>E≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> and not as it is ≈ølily gelt by the Repre≈øenter. The Pa≈ø≈øage is this: <hi>They tell us there is a va≈øt number of Sins in their own Nature Venial, which are ≈øo very incon≈øiderable that an infinite Number of them altogether, will not deprive a Man of the Grace and Favour of God, or make up one Mortal Sin; and for the pardon of which there is no need or occa≈øion for the Mercy of God.</hi> Now <hi>E≈øcobar</hi> in the place cited, <hi>Tract.</hi> 2. <hi>Exam.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. in an≈øwer to that Que≈øtion, <hi>N.</hi> 15. <hi>Whether many Venial Sins of them≈øelves, and formally ≈øpeaking, can make up one Mortal Sin?</hi> ≈øays thus, <hi>No, becau≈øe innumerable Venial Sins do not deprive a Man of the Grace of God.</hi> But the Repre≈øenter will not allow, that there is <hi>one word</hi> of that Pa≈ø≈øage, at lea≈øt, to be found there, that <hi>for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ≈øuch Sins there is no need, or occa≈øion, for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God.</hi> But I am ≈øure the <hi>thing</hi> is to be found there; For he ≈øays <hi>N.</hi> 1. that a <hi>Venial</hi> Sin is that which <hi>does not render a Man worthy of Eternal Puni≈øhment:</hi> And now if innumerable Sins of this ≈øort do not of them≈øelves make up one Mortal Sin, I think it is plain that take them altogether, and there is no occa≈øion for God's Mercy in the pardon of them, unle≈øs it be Mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don where there is no de≈øert of Puni≈øhment. 'Tis true, <hi>E≈øcobar</hi> ≈øays that they are worthy of <hi>Temporal Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but our Author was not obliged to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that, becau≈øe that which he complained of was not, that the≈øe Doctrines brought Mens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in this World, into danger; but that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of 'em, <hi>Men are in wonderful danger of being cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a matter of ≈øo great moment as their Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> So that altho the Repre≈øenter profe≈ø≈øes that <hi>this Doctrine is contrary to their Belief,</hi> yet, at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60861:43"/>lea≈øt, he mu≈øt confe≈øs that it was not contrary to <hi>E≈øcobar</hi>'s; and therefore that he hath wronged our Author in charging him here with Mi≈øquota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The ≈øame Book ≈øays in another place, <hi>p.</hi> 56. That <hi>their ≈øaying the ≈øame thing ≈øo often over, in their Je≈øus P≈øalter, is not contrived to help and a≈ø≈øi≈øt attention,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but out of pure Vanity and O≈øtentation, or as it were to flatter our B. Saviour, or the Saint they pray to.</hi> And this the Repre≈øenter calls <hi>throwing Dirt blindfold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> &amp;c. and ≈øuch <hi>Mi≈ørepre≈øenting,</hi> that if the <hi>State or Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> were ≈øerved ≈øo, there would <hi>be a ‚Äî at the end of it.</hi> By which, I gue≈øs, he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Author were hanged. But one would be willing to know fir≈øt what he has done to de≈øerve it. Why, ≈øays the Repre≈øenter, <hi>This is the Rea≈øon he gives of our Devotion.</hi> What? that all who u≈øe tho≈øe Forms of Devotion which the Author cen≈øures, have no other <hi>End or Intention,</hi> but <hi>pure Vanity and O≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Flattery?</hi> ≈øo indeed the Repre≈øenter would in≈øinuate: But, as I ≈øhall make appear, the Author's meaning was that the Repetitions them≈øelves which he ≈øpake of, were purely <hi>vain, and do not ≈øerve to any good and prudent End:</hi> For which he chiefly blames the <hi>Contrivers</hi> of 'em, as the words plainly enough ≈øhew. But what rea≈øon he had to ≈øay this, was laid down ju≈øt before in the≈øe words. Their <hi>Manuals</hi> of Devotion <hi>are ≈øo full of Tautologies, and vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then they mu≈øt needs come under the cen≈øure of our B. Saviour,</hi> Matth. 6. <hi>tho they u≈øe his holy Name. For so in the</hi> Je≈øus P≈øalter, <hi>at the end of the Manual of Prayers and Litanies, printed at</hi> Paris, in <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> An. 1682. <hi>in a Litany of Fifteen Petitions, the Name</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60861:43"/>Je≈øu <hi>is repeated over above 130 times: And in the ≈øame Book, in the Litany of the B. Virgin, they pray to her by</hi> 40 <hi>≈øeveral Names, being only ≈øo many di≈øtinct Prai≈øes of her.</hi> Now this the Repre≈øenter thought fit to ≈øuppre≈øs, which would have ≈øhewn that he did not make <hi>Vanity,</hi> &amp;c. to be <hi>the Rea≈øon</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Devotion, but that he charged their Forms of Prayer with <hi>vain Repetitions.</hi> And here the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter ≈øhould have ≈øhewn, if he were able, that the Repetitions mentioned do not fall under our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's prohibition of <hi>vain Repetitions;</hi> that they could be <hi>contrived</hi> for ≈øome <hi>good and prudent End;</hi> that they ≈øerve to any thing better than <hi>O≈øtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Flattery:</hi> Here, I ≈øay, he ≈øhould have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Skill, and told us what are vain Repetitions, if the≈øe are not. But this was ≈øomething a harder Task, than to take a Pa≈ø≈øage by it ≈øelf, without that Connexion which would have explained it, and to repre≈øent the Author by it as odiou≈øly as he could. For, I ≈øay it again, he does not make <hi>Vanity,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> of their Peoples <hi>Devotion,</hi> even in u≈øing the≈øe vain Repetitions. But indeed he ≈øays plainly enough, that they are ≈øo contrived for Vanity, and O≈øtentation or Flattery, that they are not Helps, but Hinderances to Devotion. But however, does not this Author make Vanity to be the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> of their Contrivance, who compo≈øed tho≈øe Forms? No, not that neither; for tho that Expre≈ø≈øion <hi>out of pure Vanity,</hi> &amp;c. be, I confe≈øs, ≈øomething ob≈øcure, and ≈øeems to look that way, yet it was not his meaning, as any Body will ≈øay is plain beyond all Exception, that con≈øults the whole place. For thus begins that particular to which this Pa≈ø≈øage belongs.

               <p>And now the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Kilmore</hi> is called to account for mi≈ørepre≈øenting the Papi≈øts, by <hi>putting them upon the ≈øame File with Infidels and Pagans.</hi> For, as <hi>Delphos</hi> wor≈øhipped <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> &amp;c.

If it be ≈øaid to lye in this, that the Bi≈øhop <hi>puts them upon the ≈øame File with Pagans,</hi> let us ≈øee how far he does ≈øo. He had laid down that Rule of God's Word a little before, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip the Lord thy God, and him only ≈øhalt thou ≈øerve.</hi> And then he proceeds to the Compari≈øon, in which indeed he mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to tax the Papi≈øts with contradicting that Rule, by their practice of wor≈øhipping their diver≈øity of Saints, no le≈øs than the Pagans by ≈øerving their ≈øeveral petty Gods. But he is ≈øo far from ≈øaying, that in all re≈øpects they are as bad as Pagans, which one would under≈øtand by <hi>puting them all upon the ≈øame File,</hi> that he does not enter upon a Compari≈øon of Aggravations, in re≈øpect to this very matter of Wor≈øhip; but only ≈øhews that Rule is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this way, no le≈øs than that. Now if this be a true Charge, I conceive it is no ill manners to ≈øpeak the Truth in a Ca≈øe of ≈øuch va≈øt Concern. If it be Fal≈øe, the Repre≈øenter had done more Service to his Cau≈øe, and won more de≈øerved Thanks from his own Communion, as well as ours, by ≈øhewing the difference between the one and the other, with re≈øpect to that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than by declining, as he has done, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ju≈øtification, but very craftily the Confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion too of the Fact upon which the Charge is

But any thing in the World ≈øhall ≈øerve to ≈øwell the Charge, when Prote≈øtants are to be ≈øet out for Mi≈ørepre≈øenters.</p>
               <p>As littie rea≈øon do I find for his ≈øevere charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ≈øame Bi≈øhop, for ob≈øerving that ≈øome place their whole Wor≈øhip of God in Bodily Exerci≈øe; meaning,<note place="margin">Pag. 26, 27.</note> as I have good rea≈øon to offer for it, not <hi>All,</hi> but <hi>Some</hi> Papi≈øts. For the Bi≈øhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to lay the ≈øame charge upon the Di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (without any currying I a≈ø≈øure you), nay, to tho≈øe of our Communion al≈øo, as any one may fee, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. And what was ≈øaid particularly of the Externals, in which tho≈øe Papi≈øts tru≈øt, who≈øe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion runs out into nothing but External Show, ≈øeems to me to note no more, than the greater danger they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion are in of falling into this kind of Hypocri≈øy, by rea≈øon of the va≈øt number of Ceremonies and Ob≈øervations which they, above all other Chri≈øtians in the World, have brought into Religion. The≈øe are the Pa≈ø≈øages which Anger and Ill-will have pick'd out of the whole Sermon, to expo≈øe the Bi≈øhop to His Maje≈øty's Di≈øplea≈øure; by which one may ≈øee what little cau≈øe the Repre≈øenter had to ≈øay, that <hi>he pretends to His Maje≈øties Word for abu≈øing them.</hi> If the Reader de≈øires to know the motives he had for Preaching and Publi≈øhing this <hi>Sermon,</hi> he will

               <p>Now whereas he found ≈øome Pa≈ø≈øages <hi>in the Book of Homilies</hi> of the <hi>≈øame</hi> ≈øtrain with what he had noted in the fore≈øaid Sermon;<note place="margin">Pag. 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this Accu≈øation is not to be pa≈ø≈øed lightly over. Now <hi>Henry Hills</hi> could have given him abundant ≈øatisfaction in this matter, if he had been con≈øulted. For, upon the be≈øt Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I can make, I find that no P≈øalms, in Twelves, were Printed in <hi>Oxford</hi> before the the Year 1684, and therefore no ≈øuch Impre≈ø≈øion, as the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenter means, could be there in 1683. But this is not all: for neither had tho≈øe Printed in 1684, that <hi>hearty Family-Prayer,</hi> which he talks of. But the Truth of the Ca≈øe is this, <hi>Henry Hills,</hi> or he and his Partners, had Printed the≈øe very P≈øalms, in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60861:46"/>Twelves, which the Repre≈øenter mentions, and that to a va≈øt number, as I am informed by tho≈øe who will make it out, if it be required. Now if <hi>Henry Hills</hi> bound up his P≈øalms with the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Common-Prayer Books, the Univer≈øity is no more to an≈øwer for that, than if he had bound up his own Life with one of them. It is ≈øuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Sugge≈øtion the Repre≈øenter offers at in a Marginal Note el≈øewhere,<note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> where he makes the Fire of <hi>London</hi> to be imputed to the Papi≈øts, in the <hi>Plates of the Common-Prayer Books Printed at</hi> Oxford, An. 1680.

               <p>Another way of Mi≈ø-repre≈øenting them which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, is <hi>in laying on the colours with ≈øo much craft on the Papi≈øts Tenets, that though they are the very ≈øame, with what the most learned Prote≈øtants hold them≈øelves, yet they ≈øhall appear ≈øo foul and mon≈øtrous, as if nothing le≈øs than a certain Damnation attended their Abetters.

                  <q>I have ≈øo much Charity (and I de≈øire always to have it) as to hope that a great many among them who live piou≈øly, and have been almo≈øt inevitably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Church by the prejudice of Education and an invincible Ignorance, will upon a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance find mercy with God.</q> Now in≈øtead of this, the Repre≈øenter <hi>expected</hi> from the Doctor <hi>≈øome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary piece of Charity both for the Reformation and example of the Papi≈øts;</hi> and <hi>yet,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>after all the outcry and bus≈øle, he wont allow one more grain of Mercy to the Papi≈øts, then the Papi≈øts do to them, that is onely to ≈øuch who having lived piou≈øly and truly repented of their Sins, have an invicible Ignorance to attone for all other errours of the under≈øtanding, which is the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Papi≈øts, in re≈øpect of ≈øuch who die out of the Communion of their Church.</hi> So that we have Mi≈ø-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented Papi≈øts in pretending that they do not allow as great hopes of Salvation to us continuing and dying Prote≈øtants, as we allow to them continuing and dying Papi≈øts.</p>

               <p>Now I confe≈øs I am under ≈øome temptation to ≈øhew who is the Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repre≈øenter in the Ca≈øe; but this is ≈øo good a hearing, that I will not go about to clear our ≈øelves from being Mi≈ø-repre≈øenters upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, but take him at his word, that here we are Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repre≈øenters: nay, more than that, I will thank him for taking all opportunities to report us for ≈øuch Mi≈ø-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenters, to the people of both Communions; for thus it may be hoped that we ≈øhall never more be troubled with that Argument to per≈øwade Ours, and to confirm His, in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that ≈øince we grant the Papi≈øts a po≈ø≈øibility of Salvation, and they utterly deny a po≈ø≈øibility of it to us, the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church mu≈øt needs be the more ≈øafe, ina≈ømuch as both parties agree in a po≈ø≈øibility of Salvation in that Church, but they do not both agree upon ≈øuch a po≈ø≈øibility in ours.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60861:47"/>if he be ignorant of the Doctrines of Popery, has declared to the World, that whether in the way of Hoping,<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> or of Cen≈øuring, <hi>Prote≈øtants and Papi≈øts ≈øay the ≈øame thing of each other:</hi> And therefore I think the fore≈øaid Reque≈øts are very rea≈øonable ones; ≈øo that this one matter is in a way of being fairly compounded, and if the Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter likes it, I am ≈øure both parties are well plea≈øed.</p>

And why will the Repre≈øenter put us upon talking of the≈øe things, who had ≈øaid nothing of them, if he had not forced us to it in our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>But to ≈øee now how much there goes in the telling a ≈øtory: <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>put to death,</hi> as he ≈øays,<note place="margin">P. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Two hundred Per≈øons upon the ≈øcore of Con≈øcience, without any actual Crime or Mi≈ødemeanour again≈øt the Ancient Statutes of the Land.</hi> Two hundred Per≈øons! Truly I do not know but in her long Reign of about 40 Years, ≈øo many might be put to death. But I wi≈øh the Repre≈øenter, ≈øince he pronounces in general with ≈øo much confidence, had named <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> that were put to death <hi>upon the ≈øcore of Con≈øcience,</hi> and likewi≈øe what point of <hi>Con≈øcience</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60861:50"/>it was. However ≈øomething is nece≈ø≈øary to be ≈øaid in general An≈øwer to that Charge which he plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, though he would not plainly ≈øpeak it out. In ≈øhort therefore, about ten Years after the Queen came to the Crown, Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> ≈øends over his Bull for the Excommunicating and Depo≈øing her, upon which followed the Statute again≈øt the Execution of it: Which yet did not hinder ≈øeveral Prie≈øts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuits from trying to have it Executed, in pur≈øuance whereof the Queens Life was more then once in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And therefore when no other Remedy would ≈øerve the turn, all Popi≈øh Prie≈øts of the Queens Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were bani≈øhed under the Penalty of Trea≈øon, and had forty days given them to prepare for depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This Law was made at lea≈øt twelve years (I believe more) after the Popes <hi>Breves</hi> were ≈øent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And upon this Law ≈øome Prie≈øts that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found here, were Executed, and ≈øome were not, who though coming into <hi>England</hi> contrary to the Law, yet withal, giving ≈øecurity for their dutiful Behaviour to the Queen, were, without changing their Religion, ≈øet at liberty: For, if we may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one that knew the≈øe things better then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenter ≈øeems to do, though our Princes judged it nece≈ø≈øary for their own ≈øafety, that this Law ≈øhould continue in force, yet to avoid the doing of any thing that looked like putting men to death <hi>upon the ≈øcore of con≈øcience,</hi> they qualified the rigour of it by their own Mercy, where a Trea≈øonable de≈øign did not otherwi≈øe appear. For when <hi>Goodman</hi> a Je≈øuit, was Reprieved by King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1≈øt,<note place="margin">An. 1640. Jan. 25.</note> and the King was Expo≈øtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with by the Parliament about it, he ≈øignified the cau≈øe to be this, that <hi>Goodman</hi> had been found guilty, merly as being a Prie≈øt, which was the rea≈øon of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60861:50"/>King's mercy, and that in this clemency he did but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the examples of his, Father, King <hi>James,</hi> and of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Now whether we ≈øhould believe King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, or our Repre≈øenter, I leave others to judge. This general account may ≈øerve for, his general charge; and I do not think fit to run out into more particulars, unle≈øs the Repre≈øenter gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion; but I leave him to con≈øider better of the≈øe things: And when he has done it, he may perhaps feel a little ≈øhame for having ≈øaid ju≈øt before in the Ca≈øe of Queen <hi>Mary, Now one would think to be just to Crowned Heads, the Blood ≈øhould not be expo≈øed alone to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but likewi≈øe the Occa≈øions and Provocations given:</hi> And in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s ca≈øe I will adde, And the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy al≈øo that was s;hewn, notwith≈øtanding tho≈øe <hi>Occa≈øions</hi> and <hi>Provocations</hi> that were <hi>given</hi> her.</p>
               <p>But whereas he calls the Law we ≈øpeak of a <hi>Law of her own contriving, a Law ≈øo cruel that the like is ≈øcarce to be found among the</hi> Mahometans, <hi>who though they have conquered many Chri≈øtian Nations, yet never, as he has heard of, made it Trea≈øon for their Natives to profe≈øs their own Religion, or maintain their Pa≈øtors.</hi> To let pa≈øs the Mi≈ørepre≈øentation he in≈øinuates, of <hi>making it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to profe≈øs their own Religion,</hi> it would almo≈øt tempt a man to ≈øearch the Records of old Time, to ≈øee if ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has not pa≈ø≈øed in the World as <hi>cruel</hi> as this Law, if it had been executed to the utmo≈øt rigour. For why? ≈øhould Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> under who≈øe Reign our Nation purcha≈øed ≈øome Glory abroad, ≈øuffer now at home the imputation of being the mo≈øt Tyrannical Prince that ever was in the World; beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Mahometans?</hi> and of Mahometans too in their ≈øeverity towards the Chri≈øtian Nations which they have Conquered; why, this is ≈øtrange indeed,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60861:51"/>and not to be taken upon the Repre≈øenters word: For there are <hi>Annals</hi> that ≈øpeak of a certain <hi>Law,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the Bani≈øhing of people <hi>upon the ≈øcore of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience,</hi> but the keeping of them at home to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Con≈øcience. Had they been ≈øuffered to u≈øe the Liberty that our Saviour once gave, of Flying, into another Country, when they were Per≈øecuted in their own; it had been a favour in compari≈øon to the re≈øtraint; and Death had been a mercy to the Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they endured. The <hi>like</hi> to this indeed <hi>is ≈øcarce to be found even among≈øt tho≈øe</hi> whom the Repre≈øenter ≈øpeaks of: And which made the ca≈øe yet harder, this <hi>People</hi> had not de≈øerved ill of the State, they neither ≈øided with Forreign Powers, nor with Dome≈øtic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; nay, they had behaved them≈øelves ≈øo well, that there was nothing but their Vertue to make them fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But Hi≈øtories ≈øay that tho≈øe of them who e≈øcaped by miracles of Providence, were well received everywhere, and e≈øpecially by a Prince who was not of their Religion, but yet to his immortal Glory gave them Refuge and Relief in his own Countries.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Powder Plot</hi> which he next mentions: His in≈øinuation concerning my Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> has been ≈øo often expo≈øed, and if it were true, is ≈øo unable to le≈ø≈øen the guilt of tho≈øe that were concerned in it, that I ≈øee no rea≈øon why I mu≈øt needs enter into that Hi≈øtory: We do not charge all of that Communion with it, but we have rea≈øon vehemently to ≈øu≈øpect all that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to excu≈øe, and po≈øitively to condemn all that thought fit to prai≈øe the Traytors. But if we ≈øhould have charged, as he pretends we do, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with this Trea≈øon, yet I am confident the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the <hi>West</hi> ≈øtands not altogether ≈øo fair to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For ≈øurely there was,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60861:51"/>no Act of this Church for the Excommunicating and Depo≈øing of the King; but it was the fight of the Pope's Brief to ≈øuch a purpo≈øe as that, in≈øpired one of the Traytors, as him≈øelf confe≈ø≈øed, with tho≈øe thoughts that at la≈øt ≈øetled upon the <hi>Powder Plot.</hi> And I think it was a Church of <hi>England</hi> Parliament, and a Church of <hi>England</hi> Army that ≈øo loyally ≈øerved his Maje≈øty upon that occa≈øion in the <hi>West:</hi> But let the Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øhew, if he can, that the Papi≈øts were as ≈øerviceable in the prevention of the <hi>Powder Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now drawing to an end of a tedious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which ≈øurely cannot la≈øt much longer, when he is fain to ≈øpin it out, with a ≈øtory of the <hi>long divili≈øh Knives</hi> which Papi≈øts were ≈øaid to procure for <hi>cutting of the Prote≈øtants Throats.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> For I am ≈øo perfect a ≈øtranger to the lea≈øt report of this matter, till I met with it here, that I can ≈øay nothing to it. As for the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> that I confe≈øs I have heard of, and likewi≈øe that many char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it upon the Papi≈øts; now for tho≈øe that did ≈øo, I hope I may without offence offer that excu≈øe for their credulity, which I take a hint of from the Repre≈øenter him≈øelf: It could not be expected but that the grief of ≈øo undoing a Calamity in va≈øt numbers of ≈øuffering Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ≈øhould di≈øcharge it ≈øelf in accu≈øing tho≈øe as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, who, as they believed, were well plea≈øed with it: As for the Repre≈øenter, what his thoughts are towards <hi>London,</hi> he has given us plainly to under≈øtand, in calling it <hi>a Prote≈øtant Sodom,</hi> which <hi>Heaven</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed. Now I dare ≈øay this was not meant for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation over the ≈øins and ≈øufferings of the City: But if men will go on to in≈øult at this rate, they ≈øhould however, be le≈øs clamorous again≈øt tho≈øe mi≈øtakes of which the greate≈øt occa≈øions are given by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:60861:52"/>
               <p>Then as to that which he calls a <hi>Mon≈øieur's Invention:</hi> They that gave credit to it, have this to ≈øay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, That <hi>Du Moulin</hi>'s public offer to make full proof of his ≈øtory, when Authority ≈øhould require it, ≈øtood many years, even to the day of his death; which was no improbable argument that he was provided with rea≈øonable good te≈øtimony, though it was not thought fit to call upon him for it. This may be ≈øaid to ≈øhew, that if there were never ≈øo many that ≈øwallowed the ≈øtory, yet this was no rea≈øon for the Repre≈øenters furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exclamations: For I am by no means ≈øatisfied that they who believed it, did ≈øo <hi>in defiance to all their Sen≈øes;</hi> for though there were <hi>Actors</hi> and <hi>Contrivers</hi> of the Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt, <hi>as public as the noon-light,</hi> yet I do not feel any ≈øuch <hi>contradiction</hi> in ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing that ≈øome <hi>Contrivers</hi> there might be who were <hi>not as public as the noon-light:</hi> And when the Repre≈øenter thinks of it better he will ≈øay ≈øo too, unle≈øs he will ≈øay, that becau≈øe the Contrivers of that dark Trea≈øon of the <hi>Powder Plot,</hi> were at la≈øt as public as the noon-light, therefore that <hi>it was in all likelihood a Contrivance</hi> too, of <hi>the good Lord Cecil,</hi> cannot be credited, but <hi>in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to all our Sen≈øes.</hi> And yet after all, how does it appear that we have laid any ≈øuch ≈øtre≈øs upon <hi>Du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s Relation, as the Repre≈øenter intimates: For my own part in all the conver≈øation I have had among≈øt Prote≈øtants, I can remember nothing concerning it, but that it has been ≈øometimes a little wondered at, that he was never required to prove his ≈øtory. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt the Repre≈øenter has here plaid the part of an unwi≈øe man, in reviving a ≈øtory to the di≈øadvantage of the Papi≈øts, which died with the fir≈øt report of it, as we thought at lea≈øt; for unle≈øs the Repre≈øenter thought we had ≈øome rea≈øon to believe it, why ≈øhould
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60861:52"/>he go about to complain that we do believe it? I think we have been more Ju≈øt to his Party, than he has. For our ≈øen≈øe as to this matter is, that ≈øince now the ≈øtory is not capable either of being proved, or di≈øpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is to be let fall, and the World is no more to be troubled about it; though whil≈øt <hi>Du Moulin</hi> was alive, it was not to be expected but that one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be harping upon it.</p>
               <p>At la≈øt he comes to the <hi>Garagantua Mi≈ø-repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them all, that is,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> the Divine</hi> Oates <hi>with his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øt Plot.</hi> And here, as from a Ca≈øtle where he is ≈øafe from all po≈ø≈øbility of A≈ø≈øault, he bids defyance to us with all the Rhetoric, that Anger and Scorn can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpire a man withal. But becau≈øe he lets fly at the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi> for this, and ≈øo makes the Clergy to have given what Authority they could to <hi>Oates</hi> his lyes from their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> I mu≈øt needs change a word or two with him about that in our own Defence, and tell him that neither is him≈øelf of that Credit, nor the thing it ≈øelf ≈øo likely, but that it ≈øtood in great need of particular proofs. I know not but that among≈øt Ten thou≈øand Men, here and there one might deliver the news of the <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and the <hi>Black Bills</hi> from the Pulpit. But I never heard of any that did, and I almo≈øt think that if the Repre≈øenter had known a few In≈øtances of this Kind, out they had come, if it had been for nothing but to ≈øupport the Credibility of his general Accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to go further with him, whereas he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ≈øays, that <hi>the WHOLE Plot was received with that welcome and Credit, that what would have been que≈øtioned in the very Scripture, was entertained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ≈øcruple.</hi> I will make bold to ask him, by whom it was entertain'd, did him≈øelf believe the <hi>whole</hi> Plot, while he was a Prote≈øtant? If he did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60861:53"/>we have not lo≈øt one of the wi≈øe≈øt of our Party, If he did not, neither did any body el≈øe; that ever I could hear of, though perhaps many might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more then was true. But for a more particular account who believed much, who little, who nothing at all of <hi>Oates</hi> his Di≈øcoveries, and the rea≈øons of the ≈øeveral Opinions, he mu≈øt excu≈øe me for that; I am re≈øolved not to be drawn in. Nor have I lately ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with every Man in the Nation. And 'tis onely for a Repre≈øenter to talk of the≈øe matters, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce generally without exception, though he does it al≈øo without examination of the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have waited upon the Repre≈øenter in examining the Rea≈øons, upon which he pretends that we u≈øe I know not how many Methods to Mi≈ø-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Papi≈øts, though it has been every ≈øtep out of the way: For if all had been true that he pretends, what is all this to the Defence of his <hi>Thirty Seven</hi> Chapters? What is it to his An≈øwerers, who had no more to do then to rid their hands of tho≈øe Thirty-Seven Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? And they have done it ≈øo effectually, that the Repre≈øenter has thought good to rid his hands of them too.</p>
               <p>But I think by this time, it may appear that he has all this while given us ju≈øt cau≈øe to complain, that we are many ways Mi≈ø-repre≈øented by Papi≈øts, though the Repre≈øenter without ju≈øt cau≈øe, was re≈øolved to be before hand, in the ≈øame Complaint again≈øt us.</p>
               <p>For not to repeat tho≈øe <hi>Mi≈ø-repre≈øentations, Fal≈øe Con≈øtructions,</hi> and <hi>Wry Interpretations</hi> of Prote≈øtant Authors, &amp;c. which I have ≈øhewn him to be guilty of, in examining ≈øome of his Complaints; it were a very ea≈øie matter to convict him of no le≈øs untrue then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60861:53"/>≈øpiteful in≈øinuations again≈øt all Prote≈øtants without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in this, and in his other pieces. I ≈øhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent give but one In≈øtance, and that in this his la≈øt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, where he ≈øays, that the <hi>Prote≈øtant Per≈øwa≈øion has its Name, Being,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> and ≈øupport not from what it is in its ≈øelf, but from what it is not, in defying and prote≈øting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their Neighbours.</hi> 'Tis ea≈øie to ≈øee what notion of Prote≈øtants ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øages as the≈øe are intended to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print upon the minds of Men. But does the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenter in good earne≈øt, believe that our Religion is a mere Negative Religion, and that we ≈øhould have none at all, if we had no <hi>Neighbours to defie,</hi> and to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt again≈øt?</hi> Or does he believe that our Religion ≈øo far as it is Negative, is <hi>≈øupported</hi> by <hi>defying and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øting</hi> again≈øt other Men; does he not know that we at lea≈øt pretend to <hi>≈øupport</hi> it by Rea≈øon, Scripture, and Antiquity? Nay, does he believe that there are no Affirmative points of Religion which we maintain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, and in re≈øpect of which they do in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prote≈øt again≈øt us, though it ≈øeems we have got the <hi>Name</hi> of Prote≈øtants. If he does believe thus of us, much more if knowing the contrary, he ≈øays ≈øo how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Where'<hi>s</hi> Truth, Charity, or Ju≈øtice? If we take the Religion, of Prote≈øtants, as it ≈øtands in oppo≈øition to the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is in many Points Affirmative, and the Negative is on that Churches ≈øide. For in≈øtance, that God onely is to be Wor≈øhipped, is as Affirmative a Conclu≈øion, as that God is but One, and that Chri≈øtian people are bound to read the Scriptures is as Affirmative, as that they are bound to ≈øay their Prayers, and that the Laiety have a Right to the Communion under both Kinds; is ≈øurely as Affirmative, as that they have a Right to <hi>One</hi> only. Why then does the Repre≈øenter ≈øay, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60861:54"/>the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Profe≈ø≈øion <hi>has its Name, Being, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; not from what it is in its ≈øelf, but from what it is not?</hi> But to let this pa≈øs, what although the Points held by us in oppo≈øition to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were only Negatives; yet, why mu≈øt we be ≈øo bitterly repre≈øented, as if our Per≈øwa≈øion were ≈øupported by nothing but pievi≈øhne≈øs and a Spirit of Contradiction to our Neighbours? Why mu≈øt we be brought in as <hi>defying and prote≈øting again≈øt our Neighbours?</hi> As if we oppo≈øed their Doctrines and Practices, in de≈øpight to the Jews, and not rather blamed them for ≈øaying and, doing thing which we at lea≈øt think are not to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtified? There are divers things ≈øurely, which neither Chri≈øtians nor Men ought to do; And ≈øo far as our Religion ≈øtands in not doing ≈øuch things, one would it is not the wor≈øe for being Negative, nor our Practice to be blemi≈øhed for having its Name from what it is not. And therefore when Men come in with their Negatives in Religion, and their prote≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again≈øt fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions and evil practices, they are not without more ado to be repre≈øented as <hi>Defying</hi> and <hi>Prote≈øting again≈øt their Neighbours.</hi> But lea≈øt of all, ≈øhould it be infinuated, as if our whole Religion in effect, ≈øtood in this <hi>Defying</hi> and <hi>Prote≈øting:</hi> For we do in the fir≈øt place Glory in this, that we are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians,</hi> though we are not a≈øhamed to be called <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants.</hi> In our Religious A≈ø≈øemblies, where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs our Faith before God and the World; we prote≈øs no other Articles of Faith, then tho≈øe in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> agrees with us. By this it is that we are Chri≈øtians, and it is this that makes them ≈øo. This Faith which we profe≈øs, and into which we were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is the Foundation of our a≈ø≈øurance, that if we live accordingly, we ≈øhall be ≈øaved, and of our hopes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60861:54"/>that tho≈øe among them, who are di≈øpo≈øed to receive the Truth, and repent heartily of all known ≈øins, ≈øhall find Mercy with God, notwith≈øtanding their Captivity to tho≈øe Errors, which if we ≈øhould profe≈øs, we could not have the lea≈øt hope for our ≈øelves. In the mean time for our Negatives again≈øt that Church, we offer in our own defence, that the Religion which the Scriptures teach, is ≈øuch a Negative Religion as ours, they not injoyning, and in ≈øome points forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what we do not do; and that the truly Primitive Fathers neither profe≈ø≈øed tho≈øe Doctrines, nor did tho≈øe things, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have us to profe≈øs and to do; ≈øo that their Religion was not more po≈øitive, nor le≈øs Negative then ours. But if it grieves good Men in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, that there ≈øhould be among≈øt Chri≈øtians, any Prote≈øtation of one Party again≈øt what is done by another, it is a grief al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo to us; only with this, difference, that we cannot help it, but they can. For if they will Reform the Terms of their Communion by the Scriptures, and Primitive Antiquity, they ≈øhall ≈øoon ≈øee an end of our prote≈øting, and that our Per≈øwa≈øion is not ≈øupported, as this Repre≈øenter faith, by <hi>defying and prote≈øting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt our Neighbours;</hi> then which he could not have ≈øaid a viler thing again≈øt us, no not if he had put us <hi>upon the ≈øame File with Infidels and Pagans;</hi> ≈øince this is in effect to ≈øay, That we have no Religion but in cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to other, People.</p>
               <p>But at this rate we have been u≈øed all along, though we have made no complaints of it, onely they force us to it now, whether we will or no: Thus even in their <hi>Catechi≈øms,</hi> where one would expect plainne≈øs and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, we find our ≈øelves Mi≈ø-repre≈øented in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if there was no ≈øuch way of making Novices
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60861:55"/>fa≈øt to their Church, but by giving them fal≈øe notions of ours: For at pre≈øent; to name no more then their famous <hi>Doway</hi> Catechi≈øm, there you find ≈øhall find the Teacher giving this wi≈øe rea≈øon, <hi>Why Prote≈øtants are ≈øo ≈øo divided, and damn one another for Mi≈ø-believers?

               <p>'Tis after the ≈øame way that our Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are repre≈øented by retail; of which I ≈øhall give you but one in≈øtance which I well remember, and that is where the Catechi≈øt a≈ø≈øuring his Scholar that their Laiety <hi>receive whole Chri≈øt under one kind:</hi> Tells him al≈øo that this <hi>is incomparably more than the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers

               <p>For that way of Mi≈ørepre≈øenting us by charging the particular opinions of ≈øome Prote≈øtants upon all: They have the confidence to do it, even in tho≈øe points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in neither Prote≈øtants nor Papi≈øts are of the ≈øame mind among them≈øelves: And though the <hi>Doway</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øm repre≈øents us ≈øo divided that 'tis not well po≈ø≈øible for any two of us to be of the ≈øame Religion, yet when again 'tis for their turn to Repre≈øent us otherwi≈øe, there is not an odd opinion of any Prote≈øtant, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it belongs to the Religion of all the re≈øt.

But that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is admirable: <hi>Neither,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>are they mi≈øerably mad only, but al≈øo diabolically malitious; for its of meer purpo≈øe they ≈øay and do thus, le≈øt that by clear places of Tradition and Scripture they ≈øhould be con≈øtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs that there is a Purgatory.</hi> Are not the≈øe rare Men, thus at once to charge us with what we do nat ≈øay or do, and withal to pronounce concerning our <hi>Intentions</hi> in ≈øo doing, and that in this Vile manner, that no hone≈øt Heathen ever u≈øed his Neighbour ≈øo? Nay, if you will believe this Repre≈øenter,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>They that hear Sectarian Mini≈øters are not Believers, for they do not truly believe in God the Father Almighty, nor in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt his only Son.</hi> For he knows their Hearts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they do them≈øelves:<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> and let them be never ≈øo confident that they do, he will prove that they <hi>do not believe in the Holy Ghost.</hi> And he peremptorily ≈øays that they <hi>do not believe the Communion of Saints:</hi> And la≈øtly, That <hi>neither do they believe forgivene≈øs of ≈øins.</hi> For which he brings an excellent Rea≈øon, Becau≈øe they ≈øay ≈øay, <hi>The Prie≈øts cannot forgive Sins:</hi> Though we do not ≈øay that neither, but only that they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins <hi>Ab≈øolutely;</hi> which now they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wade us too, to be their own Doctrine.<note place="margin">P. 16.</note> Thus he has made us Infidels almo≈øt throughout the Creed, only at la≈øt he grants, that we believe the <hi>Re≈øurrection of the Fle≈øh, and the Life Everla≈øting;</hi> which I wonder at, becau≈øe it was as ea≈øie to invent a rea≈øon why we believe not this neither, as for all the

               </p>
               <p>No wonder therefore that he comes afterward, and puts us upon the <hi>≈øame File with</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Heathens. <hi>As the</hi> Turks <hi>are divided and ≈øubdivided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, ≈øo are the</hi> Prote≈øtants. <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>where≈øoever they come, demoli≈øh Churches, de≈øtroy Cro≈ø≈øes, and beat down and break Altars,<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> and Images; ≈øo do the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants. <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>cannot abide Praying to Saints; no more can the</hi> Prote≈øtants. <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>love not Beads nor Holy Water; no more do the</hi> Prote≈øtants. <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>above all things, hate the mo≈øt Holy Sacrifce of the Ma≈øs, and ≈øo do the</hi> Prote≈øtants; <hi>which alone is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ≈øhew that in their Religion or Belief, they are like</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Heathens. This I think may ≈øerve at lea≈øt, to ≈øet again≈øt the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Kilmor</hi>'s Parallel: Though I ought to ask the Bi≈øhops Pardon for making the Compari≈øon. For as to that Parallel between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> it is not in every particular true, for <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> do not <hi>demoli≈øh Churches where≈øoever they come,</hi> nor <hi>break, down Altars,</hi> nor <hi>de≈øtroy Cro≈ø≈øes,</hi> nor always <hi>Images.</hi> And as to the particulars that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to both, how much malice ≈øoever there may be, I am ≈øure there is little Wit in putting them and us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the≈øe Accounts. For certainly, we are no more obliged to do any ill things, becau≈øe the <hi>Turks</hi> them≈øelves forbear them, then we are obliged to forbear any u≈øeful or innocent Cu≈øtoms, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> u≈øe them. Had this Reconciler ≈øhewn our Agreement with the <hi>Turks</hi> in ≈øome Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. that we could not but confe≈øs they are to blame for; this indeed, had been a ≈øhrewd In≈øtruction to us, to amend that in our ≈øelves, which we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60861:57"/>in People ≈øo gro≈øly deceived as they are. Now this it was, that the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Kilmore</hi> did in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon of the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> Wor≈øhipping their <hi>Tutelar Saints,</hi> with the <hi>Heathens</hi> Wor≈øhipping their <hi>Petty Gods.</hi> The Papi≈øts do with us, ju≈øtly condemn the≈øe Practices of the Heathens. The Bi≈øhop only de≈øires them, being thus prepared, to look at home. But to infer that in <hi>our Religion, we are like</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Heathens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we forbear tho≈øe things, which the <hi>Turks</hi> are to be ju≈øtified in not doing; is a Mi≈ø-repre≈øentation of us, upon ≈øo <hi>wry an Inference,</hi> that if there be not want of <hi>Wit,</hi> to excu≈øe it, it will be found equivalent to a down-right Mi≈ø-repre≈øentation, which the Genius of this Author, as it appears, by the particulars of this Book, makes me fear it is.</p>
               <p>And of a great many particulars which I might note, there is one not to be let pa≈øs, and that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> that he does in <hi>very good earne≈øt,</hi> affirm that we adore the Sacrament, though the Repre≈øenter would be thought to charge us with it, <hi>little more then in Jest.</hi> For ≈øays the Reconciler, <hi>Though they ≈øay thus of us, for Wor≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, yet they can di≈øpen≈øe with them≈øelves in Wor≈øhipping their Sacrament.</hi> And if this be not je≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis ≈øomething a great deal wor≈øe; for it is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that we do not Wor≈øhip the Sacrament, as it is that the Papi≈øts do.</p>
               <p>But to go on with him a little farther. <hi>Their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> faith he, <hi>what are they for≈øooth? Intruders, Thieves and Robbers; Hypocrites, Ravenous Wolves, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>Fal≈øe Prophers,<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> and Prie≈øts of</hi> Baal; <hi>which is their Here≈øy, Rebellion and Stubbornne≈øs again≈øt the Church. ‚Äî And if the Preachers be ≈øo, What mu≈øt the Hearers be?

                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nle≈øs they be Converted, do Penante, and live in the Church.</hi> Now this way of Mi≈ø-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentation by railing at, and damning us, is as crafty a method, as any they have to imprint upon weak minds an incurable prejudice again≈øt our Communion. For when we are confidently repre≈øented as damnable Wretches, that ≈øhall certainly be <hi>Damned,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>Prote≈øtants;</hi> e≈øpecially by Men, that at other times talk demurely, and always look gravely when they give us the≈øe good words, it cannot be expected, but that ≈øome or other ≈øhould believe there is more then ordinary Rea≈øon for it, though they are not able to find it out. We may ≈øay what we will in our own Defence, let but the≈øe Men go on to ≈øay ≈øtill that we are <hi>Damned,</hi> and the very noi≈øe and din of the≈øe words, and the like, ≈øhall make them deaf to all the Rea≈øons we can bring. And therefore every degree of this dealing, is to be condemned in any party, wherever it is found, becau≈øe it is a way to work upon the Pa≈ø≈øions and Imaginations of People; and in≈øtead of directing, it does but confound their Judgment. But I mu≈øt needs ≈øay, we have ≈øuffered under this inju≈øtice by tho≈øe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> beyond any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that I have yet ≈øeen.</p>
               <p>Of which, I will give the Repre≈øenter one in≈øtance ≈øo remarkable, that it may ≈øerve in≈øtead of a great many.

                  <hi>wor≈øe then Infidels;</hi> nay, he ≈øays that the <hi>Fiends of Hell begat Lutherans and Calvini≈øts;</hi> and that <hi>we would ≈øay if we durst, that Christ is the Abomination of De≈øolation,<note place="margin">F. 194. F. 225.</note> and that Antichri≈øt is the true God.</hi> And then I think he had rea≈øon to ≈øay, That <hi>the Devil coming from Hell, hath carried us away.</hi> Thus in his <hi>Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> he bids the <hi>Hell-hounds of</hi> Zuinglius <hi>and</hi> Luther<hi>'s, Litter,<note place="margin">Rejoynd. <hi>p.</hi> 178, 207, 111.</note> bark until their bellies break;</hi> and calls the <hi>Defender</hi> one that <hi>is like a mad Dog;</hi> and for all this, tells him that he <hi>will leave his Vile Eloquence to him≈øelf,</hi> [the Defender.] He that has a mind to ≈øee more of this, may find two Pages in Folio full of it, ju≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preface to the Bi≈øhops Defence of his Apology.

               </p>
               <p>I do not ≈øay, that they never ≈øpeak of us, but in this ≈øtrain; for I do well remember that the <hi>Apology</hi> for the Papi≈øts which came out about Six or Seven Years after the Re≈øtoration, treats us after another manner, I mean <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>s</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for then it could call us <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers,</hi> and would fain unite them and us together again≈øt the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natics:</hi> For why? then we were ≈øome-body, and it was not ami≈øs to <hi>curry</hi> with us: But there was a time when we indeed were as no-body; and then the Di≈ø≈øenters were worth being <hi>curried</hi> with; in≈øomuch that Dr. <hi>Holden,</hi> who was always e≈øteemed by us as a per≈øon of the be≈øt temper and true≈øt moderation among them,

               <p>But to return to our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> He wi≈øely con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we might take ≈øanctuary in the <hi>Bible</hi> again≈øt the hard words and reproaches they per≈øecute us with; and therefore to ≈øpoil that retreat, he will not allow that we have the Word of God among≈øt us; for thus he faith, <hi>The Prote≈øtants, or Sectarian</hi> Bible <hi>is defective, therefore evil, and con≈øequently not the Word of God; for, be≈øides, what we have above ≈øaid, almost every year
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60861:59"/>they correct it and mend it, chop it and change it, as do their Almanacks, adding thereunto what they will, and ≈øubtracting what they plea≈øe.</hi> This is ≈øuch Mi≈ø-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting, that I had rather the Repre≈øenter ≈øhould give the proper name to it, then do ≈øo my ≈øelf: Nay, if this man were to be believed, we make ≈øuch material alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the Ver≈øion or Edition of our <hi>Bible</hi> every year, as infers a nece≈ø≈øity of altering our Religion upon it, the <hi>Bible</hi> being the ground of our Religion; for ≈øays he, <hi>Neither do they change their</hi> Bible <hi>onely, but al≈øo their Religion and Fa≈øhion thereof grounded on it.

But then if he had pretended particular Proofs, he had laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf open to be particularly baffed: for which rea≈øon the ≈øafe≈øt way, was to ≈øay in general, The Servants ≈øaid ≈øo, and the thing is plain, and there's an end.</p>
               <p>Thus al≈øo <hi>Cochles</hi> repre≈øents <hi>Luther</hi>'s Death, <hi>viz.</hi> That he went to Bed merry and drunk, and was next morning found deal in his Bed; his Body being black, and his Tongue lolling out, as if he had been ≈øtrangled, which ≈øome think was done by the Devil, ≈øome by his Wife; and as they carried him to the Church to bury him, his Body ≈øtank ≈øo that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to throw it into a Ditch, and ≈øo they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is a very plea≈øant ≈øtory, but that another tells it ≈øo cro≈øly, that 'tis impo≈ø≈øible but one of them mu≈øt be guilty of Lee≈øing. The truth is, they were ≈øo impatient, that the≈øe kind of Tales were told and ≈øent up and down before the Man him≈øelf was dead, as I ≈øhall further acquaint the Repre≈øenter when he de≈øires it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I <hi>forbear,</hi> as he ≈øays, and wi≈øh there may be no occa≈øion given, to carry on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øy in this manner. This very little that I have ≈øaid of a great deal more that remains, being de≈øigned only to ≈øhew them what may be done, if the think fit to leave the Que≈øtion, and to fall upon us for Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repre≈øenting them, in≈øtead of maintaining their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines like Scholars and Di≈øputants.</p>
               <p>There remains now but one thing more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, and that is, What Rea≈øon the Repre≈øenter had to tax the Author of the <hi>Expo≈øition</hi> of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60861:62"/>with <hi>wi≈øhing for Moderation in the deepe≈øt Satyr, condemning the want of Civility in others, with the mo≈øt exa≈øperating Reflections of his own,</hi> and a great deal more to this purpo≈øe; which according to the mo≈øt impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment that I can make, is all ≈øaid without Cau≈øe given. And the declamation of the Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here upon, ≈øhews only that if he had lighted upon a fit Subject, the man does not want words to ≈øet it out to the Life. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply, </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 45.</note> But what has that Author done? He charges them with <hi>their Art of Palliating, with want of Fairne≈øs and Civility, with laying a≈øide Moderation, and falling into a vein of Lightne≈øs and Scurrility, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Religion is the Subject, and Chri≈øtians and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars their Antageni≈øts,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60861:62"/>≈øcarce one that has le≈øs keenne≈øs, then that they <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate.</hi> If they bring in a <hi>Zealous Brother Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> our Church, in≈øtead of Defending their own; could any thing be more cool, then to complain of <hi>want of Fairne≈øs and Civility,</hi> then to re≈øent their <hi>Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Vein of Lightne≈øs and Scurrility;</hi> and to put them in mind that <hi>Religion is the Subject, and Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Scholars their Antagoni≈øts.</hi> If this be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matter of Accu≈øation too, we have an ill time of it, who mu≈øt have to do with men that can well enough endure to do all the≈øe things, but cannot endure to hear of it again, though in the milde≈øt way of Repre≈øenting it: Had that Author, who≈øe Books the Repre≈øenter may be a≈øhamed to acknowledge that he has read; had he, I ≈øay, written in the Repre≈øenter's ≈øtrain, had he ≈øaid any thing like making the King's Capital City a <hi>Prote≈øtant Sodom,</hi> and the Fires of <hi>Southwark</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> our <hi>Evangelical Proofs</hi> again≈øt the Papi≈øts; and the Preachers <hi>Theme</hi> the <hi>alarum to keep the drow≈øie Flook from nodding;</hi> had he ≈øet the Repre≈øenter any example of ≈øuch unhand≈øome levities as the≈øe are; and which, to ≈øay no more, are hardly tolerable upon the ≈øtage, then indeed the ju≈øtice of his charge would not have born him out in his management of it: But when that excellent man had charged them with no more then what he has terribly proved, and that is <hi>Palliating,</hi> or with no more then what is flagrant in their la≈øt pieces, viz. <hi>Want of Fairne≈øe and Civility,</hi> &amp;c. in a word, with no more then what is true; and this without virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ≈øo much as levity of expre≈ø≈øion, (for which I leave the World to judge by tho≈øe very phra≈øes which the Repre≈øenter has picked out of his la≈øt Book) and yet for this, <hi>his Pen</hi> mu≈øt be ≈øaid to be <hi>≈øteeped in Gall,</hi> and his <hi>Antagoni≈øts expo≈øed under the most odious character
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60861:63"/>imaginable.</hi> I might well make more, but I cannot make le≈øs of it, then that ≈øome men are very much <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øperated</hi> by being ≈øhewn to them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>And now, if I had a mind to take every occa≈øion, he has given no ≈ømall one by bringing in that Parable in the Scripture, <hi>Of the Trees chu≈øing a King;</hi> to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate his own <hi>≈øeriou≈øne≈øs</hi> in the <hi>Drolling</hi> Sermon he compo≈øed for the zealous Brother: <hi>But I forbear at pre≈øent,</hi> becau≈øe he pretends to <hi>forbearance</hi> too.</p>
               <p>For the advice that he has given the forementioned Author, I do acknowledge that it were very good, but that it wants pertinence and occa≈øion; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon looks more like an unju≈øt Accu≈øation, then a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Admonition. But if he thinks good coun≈øel is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be received with thanks; I ≈øay to him what he ≈øays to our Expo≈øitor, <hi>Let him turn to ≈øuch of his own Communion who have given bad examples</hi> in the bu≈øine≈øs of <hi>Mi≈ø-repre≈øenting.</hi> And let him too that gives good advice take it al≈øo; which though it be not ≈øo ea≈øie, it will yet be better for him: But above all things, <hi>Let him endeavour that their Arguments and Methods for the defeating of Prote≈øtants, be not ≈øuch as any Jew may take to ≈øtrike at Chri≈øtianity, and every Athiest to make a ≈øham of all Religion.</hi> Which advice is ≈øo good, that 'tis pity it ≈øhould be lo≈øt upon tho≈øe that need it not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I de≈øire him to recommend it to the Author of the Parallel between the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation.</hi> Let the Repre≈øenter do his duty well upon this occa≈øion; and I can hereafter tell him of others wherein his intere≈øt will prevail more then mine.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe the Repre≈øenter is <hi>≈øincerely</hi> of our Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitor's <hi>mind, That this way of handling Controver≈øies, doth rather exa≈øperate then heal our Divi≈øions.</hi> I will tell him
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60861:63"/>an effectual way to prevent it, Let them Repre≈øent their Religion like men that are not afraid to let the people know the bottom of it; and when they offer to defend their Doctrines, let them not pretend to go on with their fir≈øt undertaking, when they leave it, and fall into Invectives again≈øt their Adver≈øaries: for if they would hone≈øtly confe≈øs that their bu≈øine≈øs is to make us look as odiou≈øly as they can, they ≈øhould, for me, go on in this way till they are weary, without any recrimination. If the Repre≈øenter de≈øires al≈øo that the≈øe Controver≈øies may have an end, let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade his Friends not to produce te≈øtimonies out of the Fathers for Popery, without taking notice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers that have been ≈øo often made to them: Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if it had been given and taken, we had not ≈øeen the <hi>Con≈øen≈øus Veterum,</hi> and the <hi>Nubes Te≈øtium.</hi> Let them not furni≈øh out Books with Arguments that have been often offered, and as often an≈øwered; but take the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie where it was left by their Predece≈ø≈øors and ours, and then go on with it if they can; which had been very good advice to Mr. <hi>Clenche.</hi> Let them not begin all over again, to ≈øpin out the time, and to make our Di≈øputes endle≈øs: Let them write and do like men that hope to gain upon the World by Rea≈øon and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. As for our parts we ≈øhall be careful to follow his la≈øt Advice, and to prove our ≈øelves true <hi>Members of the Church of</hi> England, not onely by maintaining the Truth which She hath taught us, but by practi≈øing tho≈øe <hi>Principles</hi> and that <hi>Loyalty which we Preach;</hi> that as we are ≈øen≈øible to whom we owe the Liberty we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, ≈øo we may approve our ≈øelves not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, but be always able to give ≈øome good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ≈øelves, with re≈øpect to the≈øe Controver≈øies, both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>
